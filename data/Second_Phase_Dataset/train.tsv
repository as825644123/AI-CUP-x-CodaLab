4199	A.  Concern was raised at the Gynaecologic Oncology Meeting on 3.9.63 about the nature of a nodule on a fold of peritoneum between the bladder and cervix, which had not been sectioned.  The specimen was therefore re-examined.  A mucoid nodule around 10mm diameter was identified in the flap of peritoneum on the anterior endocervix, left side, and sections were taken (blocks A23 - A28).  The sections show only oedematous and inflammatory tissue with suture material from previous surgery; no tumour is seen.	DATE QAQ 3.9.63=>2063-09-03

2788	A.  Sectionsshow two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
2843	B.  Sections show a moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of head of pancreas.  The tumour consists of irregular crowded glands lined by malignant cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Many of the nuclei have a single prominent nucleolus.  There is a prominent associated desmoplastic stroma.  The tumour has an infiltrative appearance. It invades through thewall of the adjacent duodenum, extending into submucosa and focally into duodenal mucosa.  There is lymphovascular invasion in the tumour, both within capillary sized vessels and within small muscular arteries and veins.  There is also focal perineural invasion within the tumour.	PHI QAQ Null
3543	All excision margins appear to be free of tumour.  Tumour is 0.5mm from the nearest anterior serosal surface, 2mm from the posterior margin and greater than 10mm from the portal vein groove. It is well away from the pancreatic resection margin.  The proximal and distal margins of the duodenum are free of tumour and the proximal bile duct margin is free of tumour.	PHI QAQ Null
3910	The pancreatic ducts in the vicinity of the tumour show atypiaof their lining epithelium consistent with PanIN-2. The pancreatic duct at the resection margin shows changes of PanIN-2.	PHI QAQ Null
4096	There is direct tumour invasion into two lymph nodes posterior to the head of pancreas.  One lymph node anterior to the head of pancreas is free of tumour.  One node at the porta hepatis is free oftumour.  One node superior to the head of pancreas and seven nodes inferior to the head of pancreas are all free of tumour.  Sections of the gallbladder show changes of chronic cholecystitis and cholesterolosis.	PHI QAQ Null

3314	A.  Sections show a deposit of poorly differentiated, high grade serous carcinoma.  This consists mainly of sheets of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of amphophilic cytoplasm.  There is some gland formation focally.	PHI QAQ Null
3559	B.  Sections of the mass show a poorly differentiated (grade 3) serous carcinoma. Some of it consists of sheets of cells but there are patchy areas showing formation of slit-like glands.  There is patchy, prominent tumour necrosis.  Tumour is confirmed to invade the myometrium, and also invades the upper posterior endocervix, from the posterior aspect of the uterus and cervix.  There is very widespread lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium and in the cervix.  Sections of the cervix are otherwise unremarkable, apart from the tumour invasion of deep stroma of the upper posterior endocervix, and the extensive lymphovascular invasion.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.	PHI QAQ Null

1628	A & B.  Specimens A and B show similar histopathologicalfeatures. The gastric tumour is a 120mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST is adherent to and expands themuscularis propria and has a lobulated appearance. The tumour is variably moderately to highly cellular and is composed of plump to moderately atypical spindled cells arranged in interweaving fascicles with areas of nuclear palisading. In areas, the tumour cells show moderate cytologic atypia, including nuclear enlargement, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Foci of myxoid degeneration, haemorrhage and oedema are present throughout the tumour. Mitoses are present, with up to 49 mitoses per 50 high power fields. A focus of possible incipient tumour associated necrosis isseen. The tumour appears clear of the gastric resection margin. Although much of the tumour largely surrounded by a thin rim of fibrous tissue and some attenuated muscularis propria, focally the tumour extends to the inked (serosal) surface. There is no involvement of the overlying gastric submucosa or mucosa, which shows features of a patchy mild non-specific chronic gastritis.	PHI QAQ Null
2771	Immunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:	PHI QAQ Null
2845	Tumour cells positive for:CD117, CD34.	PHI QAQ Null
2884	Tumour cells negative for: SMA, Desmin and S100.	PHI QAQ Null
2934	The Ki-67 immunoproliferative index highlights approximately 15% of tumour cell nuclei.	PHI QAQ Null
3023	C. The specimen shows fragments of organising haemorrhage and fibrous tissue. There is no convincing evidence of tumour.	PHI QAQ Null
3145	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
3154	The gastric tumour shows morphologic and immunohistochemical features consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours greater than 100mm in size and with a high mitotic rate (greater than 10/50hpf), are typically associated with a high risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM). This tumour shows variably prominent moderate nuclear pleomorphism, which is of uncertain clinical significance, as cytologic atypia is not a reliable predictor of tumour behaviour in these tumours.

The gallbladder has been opened prior to receipt.  The liver resection margin is inked black.  The mucosa in the neck region and in most of the fundus appears unremarkable and the wall is 1-2mm in thickness.  However a firm masswith a granular surface is noted in the body, resulting in severe narrowing of the lumen. The serosal surface shows puckering in this area with fibroadipose tissue adhesions.  Sectioning through the tumour shows a circumferential, firm, irregular, off white tumour measuring approximately 33 x 30 x 17mm.  The tumour involves the full thickness of the gallbladder wall and appears to infiltrate the attached fat as well.

1854	Sections show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of gallbladder.  This appears to be of biliary type.  There is some gland formation but much of the tumour consists of solid cords and trabeculae of cells.  The tumour cells have medium sized and large, vesicular nuclei and amoderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The tumour invades through the gallbladder wall and extends into adherent fat.  It extends to just beneath the serosal surface of the gallbladder and adherent fat.  It also focally invades into the attached liver segment but the hepatic resection margin is well clear.  Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are identified within the tumour but not outside the main mass.  The vascular invasion includes involvement of at least one small muscular artery.	PHI QAQ Null
2639	Some of the gallbladder adjacent to and away from the tumourshows high grade dysplasia.  The cystic duct margin is free of tumour and dysplasia.	PHI QAQ Null
2785	A section of liver away from the tumour shows some mild, non-specific inflammatory changes.  There is no hepatic fibrosis.  A perl stain shows an increase in stainable iron in hepatocytes (grade 2+ out of 4).  The hepatocytes with increased iron aremainly periportal.  The possibility of hereditary haemochromatosis should be considered.

6014	A.  Sections show a 35mm pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour which is centred in the uncinate process of the pancreas. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion is present and the tumour extends into peripancreatic tissue.  The tumour cells are arranged in trabeculae, aggregates and rosette-like arrangements. No necrosis is identified and nuclear pleomorphism is moderate. There are approximately 13 mitosis seen per 50 hpf.	PHI QAQ Null
6436	Immunonhistochemical stains show strong diffuse staining for Cam 5.2 and CD56 and patchy staining with somatostatin and glucagon.	PHI QAQ Null
6567	There is negative staining for insulin. The Ki67 staining is varied throughout the tumour but the maximal staining is approximately 15-20%.	PHI QAQ Null
6708	The overall features are consistent with a WHO grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour.	PHI QAQ Null
6798	Theuncinate process margin is positive across a broad front and the tumour is 1-2 mm from the posterior pancreatic margin. The pancreatic neck, portal vein and anterior margins are well clear. The portal vein margin clearance is approximately 4mm. A lymph node metastasis is present within the portal vein margin section. (1/1).	PHI QAQ Null
7127	Eleven (11) of the fourteen (14) peripancreatic lymph nodes are positive for tumour. The one (1) pericystic lymph node is positive for tumour.	PHI QAQ Null

8974	K.  Three (3) of thethree (3) lymph nodes are positive for metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour.	PHI QAQ Null
9078	Comment	PHI QAQ Null
9086	The primary tumour is a WHO grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, however in several of the metastases (specimens D and E) the mitotic count is up to30/50hpf and the Ki67 stains up to 40% of tumour cells. Nuclear pleomorphism is also more pronounced within these areas. Therefore, there appears to be a component of high grade tumour (WHO grade 3) within the metastatic foci. Even withinthese high grade foci, Ki67 expression is still highly variable between different areas.	PHI QAQ Null

425	Specimen labelled  Sarcoma left thigh - long stitch lateral, medium stitch medial, short stitch superior  consists of a 90 x 21mm ellipse of skin attached to fat and skeletal muscle 180 x 120 x 95mm in total.  The skin bears an 80mm horizontal surgical defect.  The sutures designated long for lateral, medium for medial and short for superior are attached.  A well circumscribed, nodular tumour is present superiorly within the specimen, measuring approximately 135 x 120 x 95mm.  Lateral inked blue, medial black.	PHI QAQ Null

2280	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Zermeno):	DOCTOR QAQ F Zermeno   
2321	Sections show a dedifferentiated liposarcoma, 135mm in maximum dimension. The subfascial tumour has a multinodular configuration and shows a predominantly abrupt transition from well differentiated lipoma-like and sclerosing liposarcoma to dedifferentiated myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma (myxoid MFH)-like areas. The skin and subcutis are uninvolved.  The transition between the well and dedifferentiated components is generally abrupt, however, focal intermingled areas (block 13) are also noted.  Although most of the tumour is well demarcated by a fibrous pseudocapsule and/or adjacent atrophic muscle, well differentiated tumour infiltrates skeletal muscle superficially and laterally (blocks5 &13).  The moderately cellular dedifferentiated component (approximately 60% of the tumour) is composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells with hyperchromatic, often angulated nuclei, occasionally prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, some with intracytoplasmic hyaline globules. The pleomorphic tumour cells are arranged in a storiform pattern and haphazardly.  The stroma of the dedifferentiated component is fibromxyoid and contains a supporting capillary-like vasculature which focally appears plexiform and there is patchy mild associated chronic inflammation.   In the latter areas, the tumour shows features superficially resembling myxoid liposarcoma, however, the degree of nuclear atypia and association with a well differentiated liposarcoma component excludes that diagnosis.  The dedifferentiated component shows broad areas (estimated 40% of the total tumour volume) of therapy-related coagulative necrosis.  Mitoses are generally inconspicuous but, in the most proliferative areas, number up to 4 per 10 HPF including atypical forms.  Within the well differentiated areas, enlarged hyperchromatic angulated stromal cells and multivacuolated lipoblasts are easily identified.  Focally fibrous scar tissue and foreign body type giant cells are noted adjacent to tumour.  The dedifferentiated component of the tumour shows similar histological features to the previous incisional biopsy (21I76240).	IDNUM QAQ 21I76240   
4529		PHI QAQ Null
4533	Close to the superficialmargin moderately cellular pleomorphic dedifferentiated tumour merges with less cellular, less pleomorphic mitotically active atypical spindled and stellate ganglion-like cells. The latter component, favoured to represent dedifferentiated tumour over a reactive proliferation of myofibroblasts, infiltrates skeletal muscle and reaches the inked resection margin. The superficial margin is therefore regarded as suspicious for involvement by sarcoma. The remaining margins aredetailed below.	PHI QAQ Null

The uninvolved liver shows moderate macrovesicular steatosis and moderate chronic inflammation in the portal tracts.  The tumour cells express CDX2 and keratin 20 antigens by the immunoperoxidase method.  Keratin 7 antigen is expressed in biliary cells and some adjacent hepatocytes but not in the tumour cells.

3818	COMMENTS:	PHI QAQ Null
3828	*This testdoes not diagnose cancer. It is intended as an adjunct to other prognostic and predictive factors to aid clinical treatment decisions.	PHI QAQ Null
3973	The cobas EGFR Mutation Test detects 41 common mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the EGFR gene, but may not specify the EGFR gene mutation detected (a list of EGFR mutations detected is available from our laboratory). Other mutations, either in the EGFR gene or in other genes, will not be detected by this analysis.	PHI QAQ Null
4287	* This test hasbeen shown in our laboratory to detect at least 5% mutant EGFR alleles in a background of normal DNA. Therefore a negative result should be interpreted with caution, as it does not exclude the presence of low levels of a clinically significant EGFR mutation.	PHI QAQ Null
4561	* The analytical sensitivity and specificity of this test are 98.5% and 98.8%, respectively (determined by manufacturer). PCR inhibitors or rare mutations affecting the binding sites of PCR primers and/or probesused in this assay may cause a false negative result * This test has been processed as a Level 1 genetic test according to the NPAAC guidelines (2007).

3670	TEST DESCRIPTION	PHI QAQ Null
3687	The sample was analysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]).  Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation.  This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater.

4163	BRAF: c.1799T>A: p.VaI600G1u (V600E)	PHI QAQ Null
4203	INTERPRETATION	PHI QAQ Null
4218	The p. Val600Glu (V600E) mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene was detected, which indicates that this tumour is unlikely to be sensitive to EGFR inhibitors.	PHI QAQ Null
4375	Comments	PHI QAQ Null
4384	BRAF mutations are found in 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases (90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1.2].  V600E specific BRAF inhibitors (e.g. Vemurafenib) have been developed to inhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients.  Trials of Vemurafenib have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3].  The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [4].

5629	Summary:	PHI QAQ Null
5638	The somatic BRAF mutation V600E was PRESENT in tumour DNA from this patient. This finding indicates that methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter may be present but should be interpreted in association with other laboratory and clinical findings.	PHI QAQ Null

5919	Clinical details: cancer	PHI QAQ Null
5944	Background:	PHI QAQ Null
5956	Absence of MLH1 gene expression in a tumour can be due to heritable or somatic mutations in the MLH1 gene. Heritable mutations cause hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) whereas somatic mutations cause non-familial cancers. A common type of somatic mutation involving the MLH1 gene is epigenetic silencing due to methylation of the promoter; epigenetic mutations are rarely familial. Hence the loss of MLH1 gene expression due to promoter	PHI QAQ Null
6428	methylation makes if very unlikely that the patient has a heritable mutation in the MLH1 gene.	PHI QAQ Null
6523	A specific somatic mutation in the BRAF gene, c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu or V600E), is a useful surrogate marker for methylation of the MLH1 promoter in tumour tissue. The absence of the V600E mutation in tumour tissue is strongly associated (>95%) with absence of methylation of the MLH1 promoter. Absence of the V600E mutation is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, HNPCC.	PHI QAQ Null
6898	The presence of the V600E mutation is associated (75%) with methylation of the MLH1 promoter. The presence of the V600E mutation indicates that HNPCC is unlikely but does not exclude other familial cancer syndromes.	PHI QAQ Null
7114	Method:	PHI QAQ Null
7122	Mutation testing is performed on DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. A region including nucleotide 1799 is amplified by PCR and the presence of the T>Amutation is determined by a single nucleotide primer extension assay. This assay will detect a mutation that is present in 5% or more of cells tested.	PHI QAQ Null

The tumour expands the dermosubcutaneous tissue with a lobulated appearanceand consists of highly pleomorphic malignant cells, many of which have macronucleoli and prominent vacuolated cytoplasm, as well as, numerous bizarre multinucleated tumour cells. The tumour cells are surrounded by variably hyalinised fibromyxoid stroma. Mitoses are readily identified with up to 32 mitoses per 10 hpf, including atypical mitoses. Necrosis is inconspicuous. Tumour extends focally through the dermis into ulcerated epidermis. Towards its inferior aspect, thetumour infiltrates focally through periosteum and into bone (block 11).

9158	Comment	PHI QAQ Null
9166	The primary tumour is a WHO grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, however in several of the metastases (specimens D and E) the mitotic count is up to 30/50hpf and the Ki67 stains up to 40% of tumour cells. Nuclear pleomorphism is also more pronounced within these areas. Therefore, there appears to be a component of high grade tumour (WHO grade 3) within the metastatic foci. Even within these high grade foci, Ki67 expression is still highly variable between different areas.	PHI QAQ Null

3659	Examination of multiple transverse sections through the parapharyngeal mass show a large, circumscribed, multilobulated tumour which is surrounded in part by a compressed fibrous connective tissue pseudocapsule.  The capsule contains residual salivary gland ducts with associated fibrosis and collections of chronic inflammatory cells.  The tumour exhibits a varied morphologic pattern with cellular areas alternating with loose, myxoid and chondromyxoid stroma.  In addition central areas of marked stromal hyalinisation are identified. The cellular areas contain sheets of myoepithelial cells withinterspersed ductal structures.  The ducts exhibit a biphasic arrangement with inner ductal cells and abluminal myoepithelial cells.  The myxoid areas contain spindled, stellate as well as plasmacytoid appearing myoepithelial cells.  The myoepithelial cells have large, vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Mild nuclear pleomorphism and occasional mitoses are noted.  Focally necrosis is observed with associated granulation tissue and fibrosis.	PHI QAQ Null

4848	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
4857	Atypical pleomorphic adenomas exhibit some features that raise concern about the potentialbiologic behaviour; however these features are insufficient on their own to attest malignancy.  These include intravascular tumour in small vessels in or adjacent to the capsule as well as cytologic atypia.	PHI QAQ Null

180	Specimen labelled  Livertumour  consists of a piece of liver, 75 x 60 x 20mm.  A yellow nodule is identified, 17 x 10 x 10mm.  The lesion is located 5mm from the surgical margin.  In the adjacent parenchyma there is a small cyst-like area filled with inspissated bile.	PHI QAQ Null

562	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr N Dewald):	DOCTOR QAQ N Dewald   
605	Sections show liver tissue with a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.  This has a lobular outline and consists of thick trabeculae of cells with large, highly pleomorphic nuclei and generally abundant bright eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Many of the nuclei have a single, prominent nucleolus.  The tumour is quite well circumscribed.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The tumour extends to just beneath the overlying liver capsule but the capsule is intact.  The liver resection margin is free of tumour.  The tumour is 5mm from the margin of the closest point.	PHI QAQ Null
1190	Liver tissue immediately adjacent to the tumour shows prominent fibrosis, replacing virtually all the parenchyma.  Sections of liver tissue away from the tumour show an irregular cavity which contains inspissated bile and has surrounding dense fibrous tissue; this is consistent with a previous surgical or tumour ablation site.	PHI QAQ Null
1521	Some better preserved liver tissue is alsoseen away from the tumour.  This shows fibrous expansion of portal tracts and some fibrous bands but reasonably intact architecture, without obvious cirrhosis.  There is a moderate infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes, in portal tracts and fibrous bands.  There is mild, focal piecemeal necrosis.  There is mild, patchy microvesicular steatosis.  There is no increase in stainable iron or copper, no Alpha 1 antitrypsin globules are seen and an Orceinstain for hepatitis B surface antigen is negative.	PHI QAQ Null

1956	A.  Sections of the ovarian tumour show extensive haemorrhage and necrosis.  Remaining intact tumour is composed mainly of cells with large, highly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, oftenone or more nucleoli, and a moderate amount of clear or basophilic cytoplasm.  These cells are in solid groups and also from prominent loose, interconnected spaces (reticular pattern).  Eosinophilic globules are identified in the cytoplasm of many tumour cells.  In some of the tumour there are spaces lined by more regular columnar or cuboidal cells.  Schiller-Duval bodies are identified in one section (block A18).

1901	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
1910	The omental, descending colon and subumbilical nodules are foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma. In the appropriate clinical context, the overall morphology (including focal squamoid differentiation) and pattern of immunohistochemical staining, would be in keepin with metastatic (grade 3) endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. No previous pathology is directly available for comparison. However, given the ER and PR, as well as, focal TTF-1 positivity, the possibility of metastatic breast or lung carcinoma, cannot be entirely excluded.	PHI QAQ Null

2549	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr E Shaak):	DOCTOR QAQ E Shaak   
2587	Sections of the tumour show a relatively uniform appearance throughout.  It is moderately cellular and consists of spindle-shaped cells in a mainly myxoid stroma.  The tumour cells have medium-sized and large, moderately pleomorphic nuclei and wispy eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There are occasional multinucleate tumour cells.  Nuclear chromatin is rather bland but some nuclei have a single prominent nucleolus.  Mitoses number up to around 6/10 HPF.The tumour cells are arranged in short, haphazard fascicles.  No differentiating features are seen with routine staining.	PHI QAQ Null
3157	The tumour has an infiltrative appearance, invading fat at the periphery (eg. blocks 6, 7).  There are patches of lymphocytes in the tumour, consistent with tumour obliteration of previous lymph nodes.  Tumour is confirmed to completelysurround the external iliac vein and it replaces the vein wall (blocks 11, 12).  It also partly surrounds the vas deferens near the top end of the specimen (block 12).  Tumour is also confirmed to partially surround the external iliac artery, but the artery wall is intact.

3818	The features are interpreted asmost consistent with a myxofibrosarcoma.  The somewhat plexiform vascular pattern also raises the possibility of a myxoid liposarcoma but there is more marked cytologic atypia than is usually seen in this entity, and no lipoblasts are identified.  The tumour would be FNCLCC grade I (differentiation score 2, mitosis score 1, tumour necrosis score 0).	PHI QAQ Null
4201	Tumour is confirmed to extend to just beneath the described peritoneal surface superiorly.  Tumour extends to part of the inked deep (block 30) and inferior (blocks 39, 40) excision margins.

5053	Cytogenetics has shownstructural abnormalities of various chromosomes, and marker chromosomes with unknown chromosome content.  FISH was preformed to investigate the possibility of gene amplification in the marker chromosomes.  Amplification of the distal DDIT3 probe and MDM2 was detected.  FUS was not rearranged.  This pattern of amplification is most consistent with a diagnosis of well differentiated/ dedifferentiated liposarcoma.	PHI QAQ Null
5490	The histology has therefore been reviewed.On review it is now considered that there is abnormal fat around the main spindle cell tumour; this fat has scattered atypical spindle cells in fibrous septa.  Some of this abnormal fat is seen in association with the vas deferens.  It is now considered that the tumour is a dedifferentiated liposarcoma which has arisen in a well differentiated lipoma-like and sclerosing liposarcoma, probably of the spermatic cord.  Thededifferentiated component extends to excision margins, as noted above.	DATE QAQ now=>2065-07-30   DATE QAQ now=>2065-07-30

3557	MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:	PHI QAQ Null
3582	Examination of multiple sections through the right parotid gland confirm the presence of the major serous gland in which there is prominent fatty infiltration. The glandular parenchyma shows multiple periductal aggregates of chronic inflammatory cells which are composed of lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells. Intervening fibrovascular connective tissue septae are present which contain dilated collecting ducts and neurovascular bundles. Surrounding fibro-fatty connective tissue and non-ganglionated nerve fibres are identified.	PHI QAQ Null
4120	Within the substance of the gland, an infiltrative tumour is identified which exhibits a varied histomorphologic pattern with lobular, microcystic, follicular and cystic spaces being noted. The individual tumour cells are large, polygonal and have finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm with large oval nuclei showing prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are observed. Prominent cytoplasmic vacuolation is also identified. Special stains confirm the presence of very occasional diastase resistant granules within cell cytoplasm of occasional tumour cells and abundant mucicarmine positive secretion. The larger tumour follicles contain eosinophilic secretion with peripheral scalloping being identified. Tumour cells have entrapped nerve fibres of varying size with focal perineural infiltration being observed (block 5) Focally, a large cystic area is noted which is lined by large, hobnail appearing cells which have vacuolated cytoplasm. Interspersed areas of necrosis with associated inflammatory cells are identified and the intervening stroma shows variable hyalinisation.	PHI QAQ Null

5635	COMMENT	PHI QAQ Null
5643	The differential diagnosis considered includes a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary gland origin (MASC) and acinic cell carcinoma. Prior to the categorisationof MASC as a separate diagnostic entity by Skalova et al in 2010, this tumour would most likely have been categorised as an acinic cell carcinoma. In view of the presence of positive staining for GCDFP-15 + mammaglobin, a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma is favoured. It appears thus far from limited evidence that the biologic behaviour of MASC is very similar to acinic cell adenocarcinoma, and if one is interpreted as the other, it probably has no implications for therapy or prognosis.

3385	A. Sections of the right adnexal mass show a poorly differentiated carcinoma with a variable architectural pattern.  Most of the tumour is composed of sheets of highly pleomorphic neoplastic cells traversed by hyalinised fibrovascular septa.  Insular and trabecular patterns of growth were also seen.  In addition, there are areas within the tumour which exhibit gland-like microspaces which often contain mucin.  Cytologically, the neoplastic cells show marked pleomorphism with enlarged vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic nucleoli.  Scattered tumour giant cells as well as large cells with bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei are also seen.  Mitoses and apoptotic cells are present but extensivenecrosis is not a prominent feature. Lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The lining of the cyst wall consists of multilayered epithelium composed of neoplastic cells with similar cytological features as that of the more solid areas.	PHI QAQ Null
4313	The features are of a poorly differentiated Mullerian carcinoma which is difficult to classify.  Some areas have features most in keeping with poorly differentiated serous carcinoma, there are also areas resembling poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma, and there is some mucin production.

3293	Sectionsshow a circumferential ulcerated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within the rectum.  The tumour is composed of scattered, often widely separated, small tubular malignant glands or more complex glandular structures which invade through the muscularis propria reaching the interface of the expanded fibrotic subserosa with mesentery.  No single cell invasion is seen.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  Anteriorly, in an area presumably covered by serosa (mesothelial layer denuded) the tumour extends close to but does not penetrate the presumed serosal surface and there is associated organising haemorrhage but no adhesions are seen.  The ulcerated area of mucosa shows no residual carcinoma but there are adjacent foci of atypical mucosal glands including definite focal high grade dysplasia within the confines of the tumour.  There is a mild response to neoadjuvant therapy with moderate stromal fibrosis and a patchygiant cell reaction to foci of dystrophic calcification (the latter almost abutting the presumed serosal surface); these changes are limited to the rectal wall with no significant stromal alteration within the mesorectum.  Other features of radiotherapy effect include hyaline alteration of vessel walls and intimal foamy histiocytes.  The non-neoplastic mucosa shows patchy chronic architectural disorder with irregular and branched crypts.  No basal plasmacytosis or granulomas are seen and the crypt architectural changes may relate to therapy induced chronic ulceration.	PHI QAQ Null

1774	Sections show lobules of variably sized adipocytes with variable hyperchromasia separated by fibrous septa. The septa contain hyperchromatic stromal cells and multinucleated (floret-like) cells, consistent with a sclerosing component. There is no necrosis. No areas of dedifferentiation are seen.  The features are consistent with a well differentiated liposarcoma. The tumour extends to the deep and all the peripheral margins. Extensive infiltration of skeletalmuscle by sarcoma cells is seen adjacent to the 9 o'clock margin.	PHI QAQ Null

1562	The 22mm left breast lesion is a well circumscribed, unencapsulated fibroadenoma. The fibroadenoma is composed of ducts with a mixed pericanalicular and intracanalicular pattern surrounded by variably fibromyxoid stroma. Focally, some of the ducts within the fibroadenoma show changes consistent with atypical lobular hyperplasia/lobular carcinoma in situ (ALH/LCIS), focal epithelial hyperplasia and squamoid metaplasia. The fibroadenoma extends to the inked/diathermied margins in areas (superior and deep margins). Foci of ALH/LCIS appear clear of margins (2.5mm from the superior margin and 6.0mm from the deep margin). The adjacent breast tissue shows changes of a recent biopsy site, focal epithelial hyperplasia, numerous dilated ducts and focal benign micro-calcification. There are no specific features of phyllodes tumour. There is no convincing DCIS or evidence of invasive malignancy.	PHI QAQ Null

The IDC is poorly circumscribed and is present in slices 6 to 10 (5 slices).  The estimated tumour size is 35mm (medial-lateral) x 30mm (superior-inferior) x 25mm (superficial-deep).  The superficial margin is positive in two (2) of the slices and the deep margin is close (clearance 0.6mm).  IDC also infiltrates close to the medial margin with tumour present in the most medial slice (slice 10).  However, the IDC 'cuts out' on levelling through this slice and the estimated clearance is 1mm.  The superior and inferior margins are both 4mm clear and the lateral margin is well clear (no tumour in slices 1 to 5).	PHI QAQ Null

1509	A.  The 45mm tumour is an invasive non-mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma displays a mixed lepidic (70%) and acinar growth (30%) pattern the latter comprising angulated glands within a cellular chronically inflamed stroma, mainly around or within an area of subpleural scarring and elastosis. The crowded moderately pleomorphic tumour cells display enlarged elongated grooved nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli, occasional intranuclear inclusions and eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm. Focally sebaceous-like features are present with cytoplasmic microvacuolation.  A minor component shows mucinousdifferentiation, highlighted with dPAS staining (block A5).  In several foci lepidic tumour shows continuity with ciliated respiratory epithelium.  The carcinoma abuts but does not penetrate the elastic layer of the pleura (PL0) (highlighted with orcein stains) and there is associated pleural retraction and foci of mild mesothelial hyperplasia.  The vascular and bronchial resection margins are uninvolved and well clear (40mm-macroscopic) of tumour. The stapled resectionmargin is also clear (20mm-macroscopic).  One peribronchial lymph node shows reactive sinus histiocytosis with anthracosis but no evidence of malignancy. The subpleural scar contains dilated bronchioles consistent with broncioloectasis.Away from the tumour, apart from a focus of reactive type 2 metaplasia and scattered intraalveolar macrophages, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.

1585	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Laflamme):	DOCTOR QAQ D Laflamme   
1627	A.   Sections show liver tissue. The described nodule is circumscribed and surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule. Within the nodule there are a few thin fibrous bands and the hepatic architecture is somewhat distorted.  There is some bile duct- like differentiation of hepatocytes at the edges of the fibrous bands but no definite true bile ducts are identified. The hepatocytes within the nodule have very mildly enlarged nuclei but the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is low. There is no significant nuclear atypia and no mitoses are identified.  A reticulin stain shows a fairly orderly reticulin pattern and no significant thickening of the hepatic plates.  A CD34 immunostain shows that much of the nodule is positive but there are patchy areas which fail to stain.  The appearances are considered to be most in keeping with a hepatic adenoma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  The slides have also been viewed by Prof D Rainone.	DOCTOR QAQ D Rainone   
2562	The liver elsewhere shows intact architecture. There are mild, patchy infiltrates of chronic inflammatory cells in the portal tracts.  There is no significant expansion of portal tracts and no fibrous bands are seen.  Bile ducts are normal. There is mild, patchy macrovesicular steatosis.  Central veinsare normal. Occasional PASD positive globules are identified within occasional hepatocytes but an Alpha-1-antitrypsin immunostain is interpreted as negative.  An Orcein stain for hepatitis B surface antigen is negative. A rhodanine stainfor copper is negative. A perl stain for iron shows a mild patchy increase in iron staining of hepatocytes, grade 2+ out of 4. The changes in the liver away from the tumour are mild and are non-specific.	PHI QAQ Null
3308	B.   Sections showliver tissue. The described subcapsular nodule is surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule and is completely necrotic. The necrosis appears old with no background liver architecture identifiable. There is some patchy calcification.  There isno evidence of malignancy. The nature of the nodule is uncertain.

1732	A.  Sections show full thickness gastric body.  No Helicobacter are seen.  There is no evidence of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or malignancy.	PHI QAQ Null
1879	B.  Sections show a 60mm well circumscribed lipomatous tumour centred in the submucosaof the gastric body.  The tumour is comprised of adipocytes of varying sizes with some cells appearing vacuolated.  No true lipoblasts are identified.  There is no significant cytological atypia of adipocytesor stromal cells.  There are occasional prominent thick walled vessels with small amounts of spindle cells surrounding them which stain negative for HMB45 and SMA.	PHI QAQ Null
2337	The features are consistent with a lipomatous tumour with a favoured diagnosis of a benign lipoma.

2100	A.  The sentinel lymph node show several depositsof metastatic pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (E Cadherin negative) measuring up to 5.5mm in maximum dimension.  There are two foci of extranodal extension extending up to 0.4mm beyond the lymph node capsule over a front of 4mm. The deposit is CAM5.2 positive.	PHI QAQ Null
2408	B. Sections show a 35mm grade 3 infiltrating mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma. The tumour is centred at 12 o'clock 20mm FN but invades around the large subareolar ducts of the nipple and reaches the dermis of the nipple. The latter comprises a 5.5mm contiguous expansion of tumour rather than a satellite nodule.  No skin ulceration, dermal lymphovascular invasion or Pagetoid epidermal involvement is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
2821	Approximately 70%of the tumour shows classic lobular carcinoma morphology composed of moderately pleomorphic tumour cells arranged in solid nests and infiltrating cords.  About 20% of the lobular carcinoma component shows pleomorphic lobular carcinoma features. The latter cells display abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles, enlarged pleomorphic nuclei, vesicular chromatin and conspicuous nucleoli.   Approximately 30% of the carcinoma shows definite morphological ductal differentiation and these areas are both separate and intermingle with the lobular component (Block B1).  Interestingly the E Cadherin stain is negative in both the lobular and ductal components.	PHI QAQ Null
3534	Only one (1) lymph node is identified  in the left lower axillary adipose tissue and (Block B16) it contains metastatic pleomorphic  lobular carcinoma 0.7mm on the H& E stained section but >2mm in a deeper level examined with AE/AE3 keratin immunostain.  There is a focus of extranodal extension 0.25mm beyond the lymph node capsule. The lymph node has a rather monotonous appearance with indistinct follicles and mostly a diffuse arrangement of small lymphocytes.  The sinuses appearpatent and there is possible focal extranodal extension of lymphocytes.  Immunohistochemical stains indicate that most cells are CD3 and CD5 positive T cells, including the possible extranodal component. The T cells infiltrate atreticfollicles which are seen through the node, the latter marked by CD21, CD23, CD10 and CD20.  The bcl2 immunostain corresponds to the T cell component with no definite coexpression by CD20 positive B cells.  Cyclin D1 is negative.  The appearances are interpreted as reactive.	PHI QAQ Null

1807	A  The 8mm (two consecutive slices) tumour within the inferior pole is a microinvasive follicular-patterned nodule with an associatedthin capsule.  The follicles are lined by enlarged cuboidal to low columnar lining follicular epithelial cells which display round to oval, slightly crowded nuclei  with variable chromatin pallor, occasional nuclear grooves and eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No intranuclear inclusions are seen.  The follicles contain hypereosinophilic colloid with some peripheral scalloping.  Focal Hurthle cell differentiation is present.  Several foci of intracapsular and two foci of transcapsular penetration are present but no lymphovascular invasion is seen.  No mitoses, trabecular architecture, necrosis or significant nuclear pleomorphism is seen.  With immunohistochemistry both the background benign follicular epithelial cells and tumour cells stain with CK19 while HBME1 highlights the tumour cells only  The surrounding parenchyma is non-nodular and shows mild to focally moderate lymphocytic thyroiditis with occasional germinal centres.	PHI QAQ Null
2873	One (1) perithyroid lymph nodes shows no evidence of malignancy.  No parathyroid glands are seen.	PHI QAQ Null
2973	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
2982	The nodule is a minimally invasive well differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  The differential is between a minimally invasive (capsule only) follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and minimally invasive follicular carcinoma, the distinction depending on the interpretation of the nuclear features.  Despite the presence of dense colloid and peripheral scalloping,in my opinion the nuclear features both qualitatively and quantitatively fall short of definite papillary carcinoma and I favour a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma.  Immunohistochemistry is unhelpful in this distinction as boththe tumour cells and background benign follicles stain diffusely with CK19.  Lack of vascular invasion in minimally invasive follicular carcinomas portends a very good prognosis with predicted behaviour akin to a diagnosis of follicularadenoma.  .  There is focal disruption of the surgical margin due to frozen section sampling but in complete full face sections the nodule is 1mm clear with intervening thyroid parenchyma and pseudocapsule.  I will seek a second opinionfrom Prof L Onorati at MEDIC/SURGERY WARD Pathology NEWMAN HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued.	DOCTOR QAQ L Onorati   DEPARTMENT QAQ MEDIC/SURGERY WARD   HOSPITAL QAQ NEWMAN HOSPITAL   
4172	B.  The 12mm (3 consecutive slices) nodule within the right lobe is a papillary carcinoma with a mixed follicular and papillary architecture.  No necrosis, sheet like or trabecular architecture is present and tumour cell mitoses are not seen.  The carcinoma is associated with some fibrosis but no investing capsule is present. Scattered associated psammomatous calcification is seen both with and beyond the confines of the tumour.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The carcinoma is less than 0.1mm from the surgical margin with an intervening thin rim of compressed fibrous tissue (pseudocapsule of thyroid).  The surrounding thyroid parenchyma is non-nodular and shows mild lymphocytic thyroiditis with occasional germinal centres.	PHI QAQ Null
4919	One (1) of four (4) perithyroid lymph nodes contains a focus of subcapsular metastatic papillary carcinoma associated with psammomatous calcification.  No extranodal extension is seen.

6545	Reported by A/Prof L Yessios	DOCTOR QAQ L Yessios   
6574	Firstly I agree that the 12mm tumour in the right lobe is a definite papillary carcinoma. Definite metastatic carcinoma is present in one of four perithyroidal nodes adjacent to the right lobe.  In the central neck dissection one node containing psammoma bodies is present (in the presence of a definite papillary carcinoma in the thyroid, I would normally classify this node as being involved by carcinoma). Therefore metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma is present in 2 of 10 lymph nodes from the thyroid.	PHI QAQ Null
7085	The 8mm lesion in the left lobe is difficult to classify.  The issue in my mind is whether it is an adenoma or adenomatous nodule or a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma negative for vascular space invasion (both are almost always cured after excision alone).  Therefore in the setting of a patient with a definite 12mm papillary thyroid carcinoma in the right lobe (and 2 lymph node metastases) this distinction is essentially arbitrary and certainly of no clinical consequence.	PHI QAQ Null
7570	Based on the paraffin slides I would have classified the 8mm lesion as an adenomatous nodule.  However in the frozen section side itself there is an area of capsular irregularity which at the time of frozen I would probably have classified as full thickness invasion.  On this basis I think it is best to classify the 8mm lesion as a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma negative for vascular space invasion.	PHI QAQ Null

4286	One abnormal metaphase was detected, with abnormalities including a large marker derived from chromosome 12.  FISH testingwith MDM2 showed a signal pattern consistent with MDM2 gene amplification in the majority of the interphase cells.  This is typically seen in the setting of well differentiated/ dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Please correlate with other findings, and advise the laboratory if confirmatory FISH on paraffin embedded tissue is required .	PHI QAQ Null

The nodule abuts the blue inked surface and is 1mm from the black inked surface.  It almost abuts proximal stapled margin.  Slicing the omental tissue reveals few ?lymph nodes.	PHI QAQ Null

1284	Sections of distal pancreas show extensive hyperplasia of the pancreatic islets which in some areas replaces the pancreatic parenchyma in a peripheral  ring like  fashion.  Residual benign ducts and occasional pancreatic acini are noted within the areas of hyperplasia.	PHI QAQ Null
1556	Elsewhere in the distal pancreas the hyperplastic islets have a more random distribution throughout the pancreatic parenchyma.	PHI QAQ Null
1685	The hyperplastic islets are associated with amyloid deposition which is confirmed in Congo Red and Crystal Violet stains.	PHI QAQ Null
1809	The hyperplastic islets, includingareas where they focally coalesce, show no significant nuclear atypia.	PHI QAQ Null
1916	Immunohystochemistry shows a marked predominance of insulin staining cells within the hyperplastic islets, accounting for approximately 80% of the cell population. There is an admixture of glucagon positive cells, situated mainly around the periphery of the hyperplastic islets.	PHI QAQ Null
2197	Ki67 expression is low, staining approximately 1% of cells.	PHI QAQ Null
2258	The exocrine pancreatic acini and ducts show no significant morphological abnormality.  Occasional pancreatic ducts show mild hyperplasia associated mild atypia, suggestive of PanIN-1.	PHI QAQ Null
2443	The sections of omentum reveal a single benign lymph node.	PHI QAQ Null

2636	Sections taken from the proximal margin show pancreatic parenchyma with	PHI QAQ Null

2745	Comment:  The overall appearances would favour a diagnosis of pronouncedislet cell hyperplasia rather than a pancreatic endocrine neoplasm.  The distribution of the hyperplastic islets and the admixture of glucagon and insulin staining cells would support this interpretation.	PHI QAQ Null
3024	In addition the deposition of amyloid within hyperplastic islets is a known phenomenon in patients with diabetes and this finding should be correlated with the patients clinical and biochemical features, in particular evidence of hyperinsulinemia.	PHI QAQ Null

3995	Sections of pancreas show diffuse islet cell hyperplasia. Prominent amyloid deposition is present in many islets. Occasional ductuloinsular complexes are seen, although these are not prominent. Focally, some of the islets have a mildly distorted microarchitecture with a ribbon-like appearance although the changes fall well short of those described in so-called pancreatic islet dysplasia . There is a mild increase in B cells (~75% of islet cells present).	PHI QAQ Null

A total of twenty-five polyps have been identified in the extended right colon and all of these polyps are either tubular adenomas or tubulovillous adenomas.  The larger polyps are tubulovillous adenomas which tend to be pedunculated.  The degree of dysplasia is generally low grade with one focus of high grade dysplasia.  All of the polyps have been totally blocked and no invasive carcinoma is identified.  The ileal and colonic resection margins appear normal and the colonic mucosa away from the polyps shows no abnormality.

The sarcoma is moderately cellular and is composed of sheets of moderately to highly pleomorphic spindled cells arranged in tight, intersecting fascicles. There is heterogeneity of atypia the tumour, with discrete zones of moderate through to high grade sarcoma present. There are up to 25 mitoses per 10 high power fields, including numerous atypical forms. There are scattered foci of necrosis.	PHI QAQ Null
2987	The leiomyosarcoma appears to arise from the wall of a vessel. The sarcoma extends along andcompresses the vessel lumen, which has been highlighted with endothelial markers (CD34 and CD31). Although the sarcoma appears circumscribed in areas, and is largely surrounded by the fibrous vessel wall and perivascular fibroadipose tissue, focally, lobules of high grade sarcoma infiltrate into the adjacent perivascular tissues. The margins are detailed below. The tumour directly abuts, but does not infiltrate, the overlying adrenal gland. Four peritumoral lymph nodesshowing reactive changes are present (0/4).

4093	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	PHI QAQ Null
4361	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI QAQ Null

279	Specimen labelled  Left colon + tumour  consists of a segment of colon measuring 100mm in length and 30mm in maximum diameter.  There is large tumour attached to the wall of large bowel measuring 180 x 130 x 110mm.  The tumour appears well circumscribe, which is not capsulated and partly covered by normal adipose tissue.  On sectioning the tumour has a fleshy and glistening solid appearance with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  The serosal surface of the colon away from the tumour is unremarkable.

1120	Sections show a high grade malignant spindle cell neoplasm, which is highly cellular with marked cytological and nuclear pleomorphism.  These cells areadmixed with bizarre tumour giant cells and chronic inflammatory cells.  A storiform pattern and myxoid changes are focally present.  There are large areas of tumour necrosis.  No low grade or well differentiated areas are seen.  The tumour cells are strongly positive for CD34.  The stains for CD117, MNF-116 (pan-cytokeratin), SMA, Desmin and S-100 are negative.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is 15%.  The overall appearances are consistent with those of undifferentiated high grade sarcoma (malignant fibrous histiocytoma).  Because of the positive stain for CD34, the possibility of malignant extrapleural solitary fibrous tumour cannot be excluded.  The overlying colonic mucosa is unremarkable.  Both colonic resection margins are clear of the tumour.	PHI QAQ Null

1915	A.  The right lobe of thyroid has been completely embedded and shows a non-encapsulated 32mmpapillary carcinoma (8 consecutive slices). The carcinoma displays a mixed papillary and follicular architecture within a hyalinised, sclerosed stroma.  In areas the tumour shows Hurthle cell features. There are scattered foci of associated psammomatous calcification. No solid/insular or trabecular architecture is seen and there is no necrosis.  Mitoses are inconspicuous.	PHI QAQ Null
2384	There are several foci of extrathyroidal extension into perithyroid adipose tissue andstriated muscle, approximately 0.9mm beyond the thyroid; in areas the boundaries of the thyroid are difficult to define because of replacement by sclerotic tumour stroma.  No definite vascular or perineural invasion is seen.   The tumouris less than 0.1mm from the posterior/tracheal margin (A4 L3), separated by a thin layer of fibrous tissue, and 0.2mm from the anterolateral margin (A2) separated by striated muscle, in an area in which the muscle appears disrupted.

2968	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	PHI QAQ Null
3236	B.  Sections show a core of liver tissue.  There is fibrous expansion of portal tracts, there are fibrous bands linking portal tracts, and a few hepatocyte nodules are identified.  The features are consistent with cirrhosis.  There is a mild and focal moderate infiltrate of lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells and eosinophils in expanded portal tracts and fibrous bands.  There is only very focal piecemeal necrosis.  Bile ducts appear normal.  The hepatocytes in the lobules appear essentially normal.  There is minimal lobular inflammation.	PHI QAQ Null

309	? Transverse colon cancer invading into posterior greater curve of stomach and segment 2 liver.  Resection en bloc with extended right hemicolectomy.	PHI QAQ Null
459	MACROSCOPIC:	PHI QAQ Null
472	Specimen labelled  Extended hemicolectomy with partial stomach and partial liver  consists of a segment of small and large bowel (450mm long), mesenteric fat (up to 110mm across), an adherent part of stomach (70mm in length, and an adherent part of liver (80 x 30 x 27mm).  The adherent stomach is 50mm from the closer colonic cut end.  The hepatic resection margin is inked green after removing the staples.  There is an indurated tumour involving the wall of the large bowel 73mm in maximum dimension.  The tumour infiltrates through the mesenteric fat and appears to be abutting the serosa and theadherent wall of stomach.  It is 70mm from the closer colonic resection margin and well clear of the opposite resection margin.  The lumen of the colon is narrowed but is not occluded.  The gastric mucosa appears grossly normal.  The tumour is circumferential and shows mucoid areas in approximately 80% of the cut surface.	PHI QAQ Null

2318	Sections show a moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon.  Adenocarcinoma penetrates the visceral peritoneum of the transverse colon (Block 25) which in areas, is associated with the formation of inflamed fibrous adhesion, resulting in the attachment of part of the stomach and liver to the transverse colon.  Adenocarcinoma is not present in the adhesion and does not involve the adherent stomach or liver.  A synoptic report follows.	PHI QAQ Null

There is an exophytic tan tumour measuring 70 x 30 x 21mm.  The tumour appears to abut the peripheral (mucosal) margins.  On sectioning no definite extension into muscularis propria is seen.

1045	The entire specimen is embedded and examined.  Sections show a 10mm adenocarcinoma arising within a 70mm tubulovillous adenoma with low and high grade dysplasia (the latter comprising approximately 30% of the adenoma). The carcinoma is mainly intramucosal, however, there is focal extension into the superficial submucosa associated with stromal desmoplasia.  Assessment of submucosal extension is difficult due to loss of the muscularis mucosae in this area (highlighted with a desmin immunostain), however, the contour of the tumour extends below the adjacent muscularis mucosa and tumour nests are present immediately adjacent to medium sized vessels consistent with submucosal invasion.  No lymph nodes are identified in the small amount of included adipose tissue.  A synoptic report follows:	PHI QAQ Null

2871	A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  On the serosa of the anterior uterus there is adherent fibrofat and within this tissue there is moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  Serous carcinoma also invades the outer myometrium of the left cornu.  Elsewhere on the serosa there are scattered psammoma bodies and occasional malignant cells, consistent with treated serous carcinoma.	PHI QAQ Null
3364	Sections of the left parametrial soft tissue show scattered deposits of serous carcinoma.  Sections of the left fallopian tube show serous carcinoma focally involving the fimbrial end but no definite carcinoma in situ is seen and the tube elsewhere is unremarkable.  Sections of the left ovary show involvement by moderately differentiated serous carcinoma, with little evidence of treatment effect.  No sarcomatous component is seen in the ovarian tumour or elsewhere.	PHI QAQ Null
3836	B.  Sections of the fallopian tube show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma on the serosa at the fimbrial end.  The tube is otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the ovary show involvement by moderately differentiated serous carcinoma, with little evidence oftreatment effect.  No sarcomatous component is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
4152	C.  Sections show fibrofat with involvement by poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  There is some evidence of treatment effect, with replacement of between 10 and 50%of the tumour by fibrous and fibroblastic tissue.  No sarcomatous component is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
4409	D.  Sections show appendix.  There is fibrous obliteration of much of the lumen.  A few scattered psammoma bodies are identified on the serosal surface and within the subserosal tissue and there are a few tumour cells identified very focally.	PHI QAQ Null
4654	E.  Sections show fibrous tissue with involvement by malignant tumour.  The tumour consists of poorly differentiated serous carcinoma but also there is a component of malignant spindle cell stromal tumour.  The features are most consistent with a malignant mixed mullerian tumour.	PHI QAQ Null

2043	A.  The entire right lobe has been embedded and examined. The 40mm nodule is a circumscribed, unencapsulated, hyperplastic nodule with a microfollicular and solid nested architecture.  The nodule is composed of follicular epithelial cells showing mild atypia with nuclear enlargement, scattered nuclear grooves and some loss of polarity, however, the features are insufficient for a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma. There are areas of central hyaline fibrosis and possible ischaemic type infarction with possible cell ghosts and dystrophic calcification.  No significant mitotic activity or nuclear convolutions are seen. Immunostains demonstrate thyroglobulin expression and negative staining for calcitonin, chromogranin and CEA. There is also anincidental unencapsulated focus of papillary microcarcinoma (A12), distributed across 1.8mm with a mixed follicular and papillary architecture.  The papillary microcarcinoma is 3.5mm clear of the clearest (posterior/tracheal) resection margin.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. Away from the dominant nodule the thyroid shows scattered unencapsulated smallfollicular nodules containing macrofollicles and mild lymphocytic thyroiditis with occasional germinal centre formation. Some perithyroidal arteries show calcification of the internal elastic lamina.  One (1) normal parathyroid gland is also present.	PHI QAQ Null

There is a large fungating ulcerated tumour measuring 220 x 170mm which has destroyed and replaced the nipple areolar complex and the majority of the surrounding skin; ulcerated tumour is 10mm from the closest radial cutaneous margins skin margin.  Sectioning reveals a poorly circumscribed cream tumour with extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour invades the skeletal muscle and appears to abut the deep margin in several areas.

2133	A & B.  Sections show a 220mm, fungating, ulcerated, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma is arranged in dissecting sheets and solid nests with associated stromal desmoplasia and extensive necrosis.  No well formed tubules are seen.  The carcinoma extensively ulcerates skin, destroying the nipple areolar complex, replaces much of the breast tissue and infiltrates skeletal muscle reaching the deep margin. The mitotically active tumour cells have large pleomorphic nucleoli, irregular nuclear membranes, vesicular chromatin and eosinophilic macronucleoli. Although in areas the tumour has asquamoid appearance, no intercellular prickles or keratinisation indicative of squamous differentiation are seen, and dPAS stains highlight scattered glandular lumina both betweenand within cells consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The small amount of sampled residual breast lobules show no evidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).   Numerous foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen within the dermis (A2), breast and extranodal tissue of the axilla. The tumour extends to the superficial, radial and deep resection margins.	PHI QAQ Null
3290	Approximately seventeen of twenty one (17/21) axillary lymph nodes contain metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with similar appearances to the breast tumour.

4099	The morphology of the currentbreast tumour and axillary metastasis match those of the previously excised left breast tumour (core biopsy - 80V36805) and left axillary lymph node metastasis (excision biopsy - 80V36805).	IDNUM QAQ 80V36805   IDNUM QAQ 80V36805   
4319	A lung primary was suggested as the site of origin of the previously sampled left axillary metastasis based on the reported immunoprofile (80V36805 - CK7 positive, CK20 positive, TTF1 positive, ER negative).  The previously sampled left breast tumour (80V36805), in a more limited sample, was CK7 positive, TTF1 minimally positive, CK20 positive, ER positive (approximately 30% predominantly moderate intensity) and PR negative.  The current breast tumour specimen and axillary metastasis show similar positive immunoexpression for CK7, CK20 and TTF1.  The ER results in the current specimens are conflicting; the breast tumour is ER negative (tested twice with appropriate controls) and the axillary metastases ER positive.  Another marker for lung adenocarcinoma, Napsin A, is negative in both the breast tumour and axillary metastases, although poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma may lose expression.  In view of the advanced nature of the breast tumour, axillary location of metastases,and despite the lack of an identifiable in-situ component (the tumour has replaced much of the breast tissue), a breast primary (grade 3 ductal, NST) with axillary metastasis seemsmuch more likely than origin from a lung adenocarcinoma.  The TTF1 and CK20 results are interpreted as aberrant.  TTF 1 expression by breast carcinomas is very rare but has been reported with clone SPT24 used in this case.  Correlation with the clinical and radiological features is advised.	IDNUM QAQ 80V36805   IDNUM QAQ 80V36805   SET QAQ twice=>R2

8384	The segment of ureter and a small amount of bladder wall have been identified in thefurther sections.  The proximal margin of the ureter is free of tumour (block 56).  Around 4mm more distally there is tumour in soft tissue around the ureter (block 57) and further distally there is tumour surrounding the ureter and extending into the ureter wall, almost reaching the mucosa (60-63).  The point of entry of the ureter into the bladder is identified (64) and the bladder mucosa and muscle layer immediately adjacent to this is free of tumour.  However there is tumour, probably in a vessel, just outside the bladder wall and very close to the apparent bladder excision margin, in this region (block 64).	PHI QAQ Null

2377	A.  Sections show skin andsubcutis.  There is a moderately differentiated basosquamous carcinoma which arises from the epidermis and infiltrates through the dermis to the subcutis.  Maximum depth of invasion is 4.5mm.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen and excision is complete.	PHI QAQ Null
2673	B.  Sections show skin and subcutis.  There is a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma whicharises from the epidermis and invades through the dermis to the subcutis.  Maximum depth of invasion is 6mm.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen and excision is complete.  The described nodular keratotic lesions are solar keratoses with moderate epidermal dysplasia.	PHI QAQ Null
3054	C.  Sections show skin and subcutis.  There is a basal cell carcinoma of infiltrative type which arises from the epidermis and invades through the dermis to the subcutis.  No perineural invasion is seen.  Excision is complete.	PHI QAQ Null
3283	D.  Sections show pieces of fibrofat.  A few macrophages are noted focally.  No tumour is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
3381	E.  Sections show skin and subcutis.  The main described tumour is a haemorrhagic mass within the dermis and extending into superficial subcutis.  This is a poorly differentiated malignancy and consists of cells with plump oval and elongated nuclei.  The nuclei are large, often with a single prominent nucleolus, and the cells have poorly defined pale or amphophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are frequent and red cells are seen in clefts between the tumour cells.	PHI QAQ Null

5568	F.  Sections of breast show widespread ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) involving inner lower and inner upper quadrants.  The DCIS involves 7 of 9 blocks of tissue sampled from these two quadrants measuring more than 40mm in diameter but the exact size is difficult to estimate.  The DCIS shows intermediate grade nuclei with cribriform architecture.  The DCIS shows necrosis and calcification.  The DCIS is completely excised.  The DCIS is 10mm to the superficial margin and is 20mm to the deep margin.  The rest of breast tissue is unremarkable.  The nipple is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of invasive carcinoma.

1900	This tumour mass was attached to the serosa of the small bowel and had a smooth surface. My recollection is that is did not involve the small bowel mesentery (but I cant be sure of this) and the specimen has since been discarded.  It appears that there is no other structure attached to this mass and the small bowel resection margins werewell clear.  It is likely that the surgical margins are clear of the tumour .	PHI QAQ Null

526	MACROSCOPIC:	PHI QAQ Null
539	A.  Specimen labelled  Sarcoma left arm, short superior, longlateral, double radial head, loop olecranon  consists of an ellipse of skin measuring 160 x 100mm to a depth of 30mm.  There are four marking sutures in situ as described (orientated by Dr Elias ZABAWA, surgical registrar).  The deep margin includes skeletal muscle and fascia. The deep surfaces reveals a tumour which appears to be composed of two nodules.  Located closest to the superior margin is an exposed nodule in which the overlying fascia has been surgically divided. This nodule measures 45 x 40mm and is located 12mm from the medial margin and 40mm from the superior margin. There is a second nodule which is palpable beneath the skeletal muscle margin measuring 55 x 55mm and is located 4mm from the medial margin and 25mm from the inferior margin.  The lateral marginis inked blue, medial margin black, exposed tumour face inked yellow, radial head inked red and olecranoninked green.	DOCTOR QAQ Elias ZABAWA   
1501	On sectioning the tumour appears well clear of the superficial margin (>50mm) and well clear of the lateral margin (> 30mm). The tumour appears to abut the medial margin.  Nodules one and two appear to be a continuous single tumour.  The tumour is approximately 35% myxoid (slices five to slices eight), 30% solid and fleshy (slices 9-11) and 35% soft cream and necrotic (slices 12-16).  The radial head margin is located in slices 8-10, the olecranon margin is located in slices 7-11.	PHI QAQ Null

2885	The specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sectionsshow a pleomorphic high grade undifferentiated sarcoma nearing approximately 95mm in maximum dimension. The tumour is centred within the deep subcutis, penetrates fascia and infiltrates skeletal muscle (eg block 27) in several areas. Thedermis is uninvolved.  The tumour has a partly infiltrative and partly circumscribed profile with relatively hypocellular areas associated with myxoid stroma and more cellular areasdisplaying storiform or fascicular growth within a fibrous stroma.  The tumour is composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindled, stellate and epithelioid cells within a variably fibrous or myxoid stroma. There are capillary sizedvessels, some of which are thick walled.  There are numerous admixed tumour giant cells with hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei, many of which have intranuclear inclusions and eosinophilic macronuclei.  In some areas the tumour cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm imparting a rhabdoid-like appearance.   The adipose tissue away from the advancing front of tumour is mature with no significant variation in size and no lipoblasts identified.  The morphological appearances are similar to those of the previous core biopsy (15W55938), in which no specific line of differentiation was identified (Negative for S100, HMB45, MelanA, PANCK, AE1/AE3, SMA, Desmin).  Myogenin immunostaining is also negative. Thetumour remains mitotically active (4 per 10 HPF).  There is minimal response to therapy with only minimal necrosis (block 37) and focal areas of acute and subacute haemorrhage.	IDNUM QAQ 15W55938

3318	A.  Sections of the ovary show involvement by a poorly differentiated carcinoma most consistent with poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  The tumour consists mainly of trabeculae of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic or amphophilic cytoplasm.  Some scattered tumour cells have very large, highly atypical nuclei.  Mitoses are frequent.  Part of the tumour has a prominent associated infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells.  There is some fibrofat adherent to the outer surface of the ovary and tumour extends into some of this tissue.  There is gland formation identified focally within the trabeculae of tumour cells and there is some patchy tumour necrosis.  No tumour is identified on the surface of the ovary.	PHI QAQ Null

1730	A.  Sections confirm the presence of three deposits of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The deposits of carcinoma shows extensive treatment related necrosis (at least 50% of each deposit is necrotic). The carcinoma extends close to the overlying hepatic capsule, which appears focally thickened, but no capsular penetration is identified. The surgical margin of excision appears well clear of carcinoma (>10mm). The adjacent liver shows non-specific reactive change.	PHI QAQ Null
2217	B.  Sections confirm the presence of two deposits of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The largest deposit shows extensive treatment related necrosis (>50%) and extends very close to the hepatic capsule and overlying adherent fibroadipose tissue (less than 0.05mm) but no definite capsular penetration is seen. There is also focal squamoid type metaplasia. The smaller deposit shows minimal treatment related necrosis. Carcinoma is0.56mm from the surgical margin. The adjacent liver shows non-specific reactive change.	PHI QAQ Null
2756	C.  Sections of gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis. The gallbladder wall shows fibromuscular hyperplasia, Rokitansky Aschoff sinus formation and patchy mild chronic inflammation. There are no unusual features. There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.	PHI QAQ Null
3019	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
3028	These hepatic deposits of carcinoma have been compared to the previouslyexcised colorectal carcinoma (04B87115). The overall morphology is identical and the hepatic tumours would be consistent with deposits of metastatic colorectal carcinoma.	IDNUM QAQ 04B87115

1512	A.  Sections show skin, parotid gland and underlying soft tissue containing a small amount of skeletal muscle towardsone longitudinal margin. The tumour is an ulcerated moderate to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating from epidermis.  The carcinoma replaces the skin, subcutis and directly invadesthe underlying parotid gland and is about 22mm thick.  The tumour has a partly circumscribed and partly infiltrative profile and is mainly composed of nests and sheets of moderate to highly pleomorphic epithelioid and spindled squamous cells which show areas of keratinisation.  In some superficial areas the tumour has a discohesive pseudovascular appearance.  Foci of tumour necrosis are present. There are several entrapped nerves ofvarying sizes, however, no outlying foci of perineural invasion are seen.  Several moderate sized nerves towards one longitudinal margin and close to skeletal muscle are uninvolved.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. The tumour is 0.3mm from longitudinal margin, deep to striated muscle and above the level of the parotid (A9 AE1/AE3).  The tumour is 0.7m from a diathermied cleft close to one transverse margin (A6), however, the margin regarded as the true transverse margin is about 1.7mm clear.  The deep margin is 3mm clear.  One (1) lymph node at one longitudinal end is directly invaded by squamous cell carcinoma (A9).  There are some adjacent foci of actinic keratosis.  The parotid gland shows minor atrophy and is chronically inflamed.	PHI QAQ Null

1486	Sections show a dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  Around 60%of the tumour sampled has features of a well differentiated liposarcoma, both lipoma-like and sclerosing types.  Around 40% of the tumour sampled shows features of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  This consists of moderately cellular spindle cell tumour.  The spindle cells generally show only mild atypia and are haphazardly arranged in short fascicles.  However there are scattered more atypical mononuclear and multinucleate tumour cells and there are scattered mitosesidentified, including abnormal forms.  The background stroma in the dedifferentiated component is rather myxoid.  Some infarct-like necrosis is noted in dedifferentiated and sclerosing components but this is not prominent.  Some dense fibrosis, patchy metaplsatic ossification and focal calcification are noted within the well differentiated component.	PHI QAQ Null
2370	Both well differentiated and dedifferentiated components abut and indent the left kidney.  Kidney immediately adjacent to the tumour shows prominent interstitial fibrosis.  Further away from the tumour the kidney does not show any obvious abnormality.  A section of the ureter is unremarkable.  Well differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma abuts the right adrenal gland.  The adrenal itself is unremarkable.	PHI QAQ Null

2060	Sections of the left axillary lesion show an undifferentiated FNCLCC Grade 3 pleomorphic sarcoma (pleomorphic MFH). The sarcoma is composed of malignant epithelioid to spindle cells arranged in highly cellular infiltrative lobules and sheets. The malignant cells have highly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, variably prominent rhabdoid eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent cherry-pink nucleoli. Scattered bizarre bi and multinucleated tumour cells are also present. In areas, the tumour cells are separated by variably thick hyalinised fibrocollagenous-type septae. The sarcoma shows brisk mitotic active, with over 70 mitoses per 10 hpf, including abundant atypical mitoses. Focal lymphovascular space and perineural invasion are seen (block 1). There are broad areas of serpiginous, suppurative necrosis throughout the entire tumour (involving >50% - ?treatment related). No cytoplasmic pigment, malignant osteoid or chondroid differentiation is identified. The overlying skin shows reactive change and an organising dermocutaneous abscess, possibly related to previous surgery. At the deep and peripheral aspects, the sarcoma is surrounded by a variably thick cuff of mature fibroadipose tissue and portions of skeletal muscle, with areas of fat necrosis and a patchy myofibroblastic proliferation. A single epithelioid granuloma is present within the skeletal muscle (stains for organisms are negative). Sections through the axillary vein margin show numerous medium sized vessels, as well as, variably dense fibrocollagenous tissue. A small amount of lymphoid tissue is present at the edge of the tumour focally, and may represent an effaced lymph node. Two intact lymph nodes are also present in the surrounding fat, both of which show mild reactive changes.	PHI QAQ Null

3418	A. The sections of small bowel show diffusely infiltrative, poorlydifferentiated adenocarcinoma with a signet ring morphology.	PHI QAQ Null
3546	The tumour cells show positive staining with CDX2 and keratin 20 (patchy) but are negative for keratin 7 and TTF-1.	PHI QAQ Null
3663	Mis-Match repair gene markers show preserved nuclear staining in MSH 2 and MSH 6. Reduced nuclear staining is seen MLH 1 and PMS 2.	PHI QAQ Null
3795	Carcinoma invades through the full thickness of the small bowel wall into mesenteric fat. Ulceration is present on the mucosal aspect ofthe tumour and in other areas, carcinoma can be seen infiltrating within the lamina propria of the mucosa.	PHI QAQ Null
4038	No lymphovascular invasion is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
4074	The ends of the excision are clear of tumour and no definite involvement of the peritoneal surface is seen in these sections.	PHI QAQ Null
4200	The diverticulum is confirmed histologically and shows no inflammation or dysplasia.	PHI QAQ Null
4285	10 lymph nodes are identified, none ofwhich show evidence of malignancy (0/10).	PHI QAQ Null
4365	B. The sections of bowel show no evidence of malignancy.	PHI QAQ Null
4422	C. The sections of liver show a circumscribed tumour matching the 30mm lesion described macroscopically.  The tumour is composed of large, atypical eosinophilic cells displaying gland formation and occasional intracytoplasmic acini.  In some areas the tumour cells grow in a sheet-like and focally trabecular pattern.  The cells contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional eosinophilic globules are noted within the cytoplasm of some cells.  The nuclei show moderate to marked nuclear atypia with variably prominent nucleoli. Occasional tumour cells contain intranuclear cytoplasmic pseudo inclusions.	PHI QAQ Null
5037	No squamous differentiation, melanin pigment or bile pigment is identified.	PHI QAQ Null
5115	The Diastase stain shows positive staining of gland lining and also mucin vacuoles within individual cells.These changes are consistent with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.	PHI QAQ Null
5289	The centre of the tumour shows organising fibrosis with entrapped vessels and bile ducts.	PHI QAQ Null
5381	The tumour cells show strong positive staining for Keratin 7 and Keratin 19.   CD20 shows patchy positive staining but CDX2 is negative.	PHI QAQ Null
5520	The tumour cells are also negative for hepatocystic markers (Hepar-1, Alpha fetoprotein).  Alpha 1 antitrypsin shows diffuse positivity within the liver and also within the tumour, of uncertain significance.	PHI QAQ Null
5730	The tumour cells show patchy positive staining with CEA.  CD34 stains blood vessels within the tumour nodule and also in surrounding portal tracts.	PHI QAQ Null
5880	CD10 is negative.	PHI QAQ Null
5900	Melanocytic markers (HMB45 and S100) are negative.	PHI QAQ Null
5953	Prostatic specific antigens and TTF1 are both negative.	PHI QAQ Null
6011	liver immediately surrounding the tumour deposit shows mild fatty change.  The portal tracts are variably expanded by proliferating bile ductules and a mixed, predominately chronic, inflammatory cells infiltrate.  Chronic inflammatory cells are also noted within the hepatic lobules.  No bile lakes are seen but there is mild sinusoidal dilatation.  These changes may reflect local obstructive or reactive changes due to the presence of a tumour nodule.  Elsewhere the liver is non cirrhotic and shows mild steatosis and a mild increase in inflammatory cells within the portal tracts.	PHI QAQ Null
6598	The tumour is clear of the surgical margin in the region of the porta hepatis by 10mm.	PHI QAQ Null
6687	The morphological and Immunohistochemical appearances of the tumour in the liver are distinctly different to those seen in the small bowel tumour.  This would support the theory that these represent two separate neoplastic processes.  Neither tumour is particularly typical of colorectal carcinoma however a signet ring morphology is sometimes seen in colorectal carcinomas and therefore the smallbowel tumour may still represent a metastasis from that site.  The morphology of the liver tumour however is more suggestive of either a primary cholangiocarcinoma in the liver or metastatic carcinoma from an upper gastrointestinal siteor possibly a pancreaticobiliary origin.	PHI QAQ Null

2491	Approximately 90% of the 250mm tumour is well differentiated liposarcoma.  The remaining 10% (one of the demarcated nodules described grossly) comprises grade de-differentiated liposarcoma, 90mm in maximum dimension and present inferiorly within the specimen.  The second well demarcated myxoid nodule, at the superior end of the specimen comprises well differentiated liposarcoma with sclerosing and myxoid areas. The well differentiated areas shows lipoma-like, sclerosing and inflammatory morphology.  There are interspersed areas with myxoid stromal alteration and non-plexiform capillary like vasculature.  Well differentiated liposarcoma encases the rightadrenal gland and right kidney and extends into the renal hilum merging with renal hilar fat. The inferiorly located dedifferentiated nodule is composed of moderately cellular tumour composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindle and stellate cells, as well as, scattered bizarre multinucleated giant cells. Mitoses are easily identified.  No necrosis is seen.  No heterologous differentiation is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
3562	The tumour margins are as follows.	PHI QAQ Null
3599	Well differentiated liposarcoma extends to the posteromedial, posterolateral, inferior and superior margins.  The renal hilar fat margin is probably clear, however, assessment is difficult as there is a paucity of specimen ink in this area.	PHI QAQ Null

364	Specimen labelled  Right colon  consists of a right hemicolectomy with appendix and attached terminal ileum.  The caecum and appendix have been opened longitudinally prior toreceipt at the laboratory.  The terminal ileum is 100mm in length x 20 x 15mm in maximum diameter.  The caecum and ascending colon are 90mm in length x 60 x 30mm in maximum dimension.  The serosa surrounding the appendix is dull and congested, elsewhere the serosa appears normal.  The appendix is 65mm in length and 10 x 8mm in maximum dimension and there is attached mesoappendix up to 70mm wide.  In the distal appendix there is a mucinous mass; this measures 25mm longby 15mm wide and is 30mm from the proximal end of the appendix at the closest point.  The mucinous mass appears to involve the full thickness of the appendix wall and appears to extend directly into the attached mesoappendix.  Several lymph nodes are identified in the mesocolon..

1815	The whole appendix has been blocked.  Sections of the abnormal area show distensionof the appendix by mucus, with associated marked attenuation of some of the appendix wall.  Mucus tracks into part of the appendix wall, almost reaching the subserosal fat.  No mucus is seenextending into mesenteric fat or to the serosal surface.  The mucus in the appendix lumen is partly calcified.	PHI QAQ Null
2201	In the abnormal area the appendiceal mucosa is replaced by abnormal mucinous epithelium.  This shows low grade dysplasia with nuclear enlargement and variable crowding.  Some of the abnormal mucosa also has featuresof a sessile serrated adenoma.  Focally there is some abnormal epithelium, associated with mucus which has dissected into the inner appendix wall.  No abnormal epithelium is seen extending through the wall and no invasive carcinoma is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
2659	The features are of low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  If mucus with associated abnormal epithelium has previously escaped into the peritoneal cavity then there is some risk of the later development of pseudomyxoma peritonei.  However, on the basis of the evidence in this specimen, the risk in this case would seem to be low.	PHI QAQ Null

1949	A - C.  Specimens A, B and C show similar histopathological features. The left upper thigh and retroperitoneal lesions are mildly cellular myxoid tumours composed of bland to stellate cells, within a predominantly myxoid stroma. Very occasional cells show very mild nuclear enlargement, nuclear inclusions and hyperchromasia. Scattered thin fibrous septae, as wellas, acellular mucin lakes and ganglion-like cysts, are present. There are also numerous small thin walled blood vessels, but no  chicken-wire  or  curvilinear  vessels are identified. There is no significant mitotic activity or necrosis. The tumours are partially surrounded by a fibrous pseudo-capsule, as well as, a cuff of focally atrophic skeletal muscle and mature fibroadipose tissue. Focally, myxoid tumour dissects between skeletal muscle fibres and adipocytes and is present at the inked surgical margins. Nolipoblasts are identified. The sections of deep margin of left thigh contain myxoid tumour which extends widely to the surgical margin.	PHI QAQ Null
2967	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
2976	The left upper thigh and retroperitoneal (psoas) lesions are myxoid lesions with morphologic features consistent with intramuscular mxyoma(s). Theappearance is similar to that of the previously described left groin/thigh myxoma (50V95819).	IDNUM QAQ 50V95819   
3217	Local recurrence of intramuscular myxomas is unusual and raises the pathologic differential diagnosis of a low grade myxoid sarcoma, such as: low grade fibromyxoid tumour and myxoid liposarcoma. However, the overall morphology, including low cellularity, absence of lipoblasts and curvilinear/chicken wire vessels, makes these differentials less likely. However, if requested, FISH testing could help to exclude a low grade sarcoma (FUS - fibromyxoid sarcoma; DDIT3 - myxoid liposarcoma).	PHI QAQ Null
3707	There is no evidence of high grade sarcoma.	PHI QAQ Null

3798	A.  Sections show  a poorly differentiated carcinoma of cervix with areas of well formed glands, areas with a glassy cell carcinoma-like appearance, and also very focal squamous differentiation.  The tumour consists of sheets and trabeculae of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei, often a single prominent nucleolus and a moderate amount of amphophilic or pale cytoplasm.  There is a dense inflammatory infiltrate, consisting mainly of eosinophils but also with some lymphocytes and plasma cells, within and around the tumour.  The tumour is considered to be best classified as a form of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma but with some glassy cell features.  It invades deeply into cervical stroma.  Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion is11mm where total stromal thickness is 19mm.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  The ectocervical excision margin is well clear; the closest ectocervical margin is around 14mm.  Focal adenocarcinoma in situ is identified in the cervix (block A9) and there is also focal HPV effect and CIN3 (block A7).  No definite tumour extension into the lower uterine segment is seen.

4490	Comment:	PHI QAQ Null
4500	Immunohistochemistry of cancer tissues for mismatch repair proteins is a surrogate marker for MSI status, with an absence of one or more of the mismatch repair proteins considered an abnormal result.  Tumours that show loss of MMR proteins are almost always characterised by microsatellite instability (MSI-H).   MSI in endometrial (and colorectal) cancer results from defective DNA MMR, either due to germline-inactivating DNA MMR mutations (Lynch syndrome patients), or epigenetic inactivation of the MLH1 gene by promoterhypermethylation (sporadic tumors).   Approximately 20% to 30% of endometrial carcinomas have microsatellite instability, and an epigenetic (sporadic) cause of MSI is more common than Lynch syndrome.  Correlation with family history and other findings recommended.	PHI QAQ Null

1922	There is an endometrioid adenocarinoma involving anterior and posterior uterine body. In most areas of the tumour there is no myoinvasionhowever there is invasion into the myometrium in left cornu sections. This is associated with adenomyosis in this area and adenocarcinoma partly colonises adenomyosis. However the deeper parts of the tumour have rounded sheets of tumour without stroma and this is considered invasive rather than adenomyosis. Deep to this there is more easily recognised invasion with angulated small glands and single tumour cells with a desmoplastic stromal reaction.	PHI QAQ Null

3617	Comment:	PHI QAQ Null
3626	A binary scheme has been proposed for grading appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei, with all tumours with significant spreadbeyond right lower quadrant (bona fide pseudomyxoma) termed mucinous carcinoma peritonei (low grade versus high grade). This low/high grade stratification is similar to Ronnett scheme and WHO.  Tumours with intermediate or hybrid features (PMCA-Intermediate -Ronnett) are grouped with low grade tumours in the Bradley scheme in view of similar behaviour in their series, and in a later series (Chua 2012), but less favourable behaviour was described in the earlier Ronnettseries for this intermediate group.	PHI QAQ Null
4256	This type of tumour would generally but not exclusively be of appendix origin. From the sections available from the previous appendicectomy from 19/12/2060, although there is a small mucosal probable adenomatous lesion presentin one of the sections (see separate review), it would be difficult to definitely conclude that this was the primary lesion histologically. The peritoneal mucinous neoplasm epithelium is more eosinophilic and not very similar to the smallatypical focus in the appendix. Clinical correlation recommended.	DATE QAQ 19/12/2060=>2060-12-19

2653	A.  The 45mm right kidney tumour is a conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The carcinoma has alobulated appearance and is composed of sheets and nodules of carcinoma cells with moderately pleomorphic nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli and clear cytoplasm. The tumour cellsare arranged in solid and trabecular patterns and are surrounded by a prominent anastomosing network of blood vessels. Although the nuclei show predominantly Fuhrman grade 3 features, in areas, there is spindle cell (sarcomatoid) change, consistent with an overall Fuhrman grade 4tumour. At the superior pole of the kidney, carcinoma infiltrates through the renal capsule into perinephric adipose tissue and is seen 0.3mm from the inked perinephric fat margin. Focally, carcinoma extends beyond the perinephric fat and into a cuff of overlying partially adherent liver tissue. Tumour within the liver tissue appears clear of the surrounding inked hepatic surgical margins (>5.5mm).	PHI QAQ Null
3618	At the hilum, tumour nodules abut hilar fat. Tumour is present within the lumen of the renal vein and appears partially incorporated into the renal vein wall. Tumour is not present in the section of the renal vein margin, renal artery margin or ureteric margin. The adjacent non-neoplastic renal parenchymashows patchy glomerulosclerosis and mild chronic inflammation. The adrenal gland appears within normal histologic limits and shows no involvement by carcinoma.	PHI QAQ Null

1176	A, B.  Sections show pieces of tumour tissue and a small amount of adjacent gliotic brain tissue.  The tumour consists of lobules and ribbons of stratified squamous epithelium which focally includes a few mucin containing goblet cells.  The squamous epithelium sits on a loose fibrous stroma.  Within the sheets and lobules of epithelium there are loose reticular areas consistent with stellate reticulum.  Some palisading is seen at the base of the epithelium but this is not particularly prominent.  There is focal calcification.  Some pieces of tumour have a somewhat papillary architecture.  There is no necrosis and there is no cytologic atypia or evidence of malignancy.  There is a moderate, patchy infiltrate of mixed chronic inflammatory cells in part of the stroma.  The appearances are of a craniopharyngioma.	PHI QAQ Null

2733	There are several features which do not fit for adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma in this case, including the lack of wet keratin, the only focal calcification, the demonstration of some mucous containing goblet cells, and the lack of a surrounding xanthomatous tissue reaction.  Also, there is no aberrant nuclear staining for beta catenin and there is now positive BRAF staining.	DATE QAQ now=>2065-07-30

2957	A.  Histology shows a distended appendix with the mucosa replaced by relatively monotonous flattened columnar mucinous epithelium which shows some micropapillary tufting in places.  There is low grade cytological atypia and morphology is consistent with that of a low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  Additionally, there are widespread deposits of abundant extracellular mucinous material over the serosal aspect of the appendix and also within the wall which shows fibrosis and loss of the muscularis propria in places.  Scattered within these mucinous pools are occasional strips of low grade atypical mucinous epithelium.  No areas of high grade or frankly malignant invasive adenocarcinoma are seen.  At the proximal end of the appendix adjacent to the resection margin the mucosa appears more normal showing only minor hyperplastic changes with no significant atypia.	PHI QAQ Null

Histology shows deposits of mucinous tumour within the peritoneal tissue, over the serosa and within the stroma, predominantly of the left ovary, with small deposits also seen over the serosa of the left fallopian tube, right ovary, focally the serosa of the uterus, gallbladder and spleen.  In most of these areas, the cytology of the epithelium is predominantlylow grade, but within the left ovary there is moderate cytological atypia, more in keeping with intermediate grade mucinous tumour, although not frankly malignant high-grade adenocarcinoma.  Otherwise the endometrium of the uterus is atrophic with mild adenomyosis.  A small intramural leiomyoma is also seen.  The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.  A small focus of ectopic adrenal is also seen within the subserosal tissue adjacent to the left tube and ovary. The skin of the umbilicus is not involved	PHI QAQ Null

2640	A.  Sections show an endometrial grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The tumour contiguously invades into the outer half of the myometrium 14mm through myometrium 15mm thick.  The tumour reaches the mucosa of the lower segment but there is no endocervical mucosal or stromal involvement.  Two small foci highly suspiciousfor lymphovascular invasion are seen at the deep advancing front of tumour, on D240 immunostaining (A4).  No serosal involvement is seen.  The tumour shows areas of mucinous and squamous differentiation and is arranged predominantly inwell formed tubular of complex glands with focal micropapillary architecture (architectural grade 1).  The tumour nuclei, in areas, displaygrade 3 features with nuclear rounding, chromatin clearing and nucleoli and hence the  overall tumour FIGO grade is 2.  The uterus containsfoci of adenomyosis.

2674	The sample was analysed by direct sequencing. Exon 11, 13 and 17 of KIT were assessed.  The sensitivity of the test is 20-30%. At least 20-30% tumour cells should be in thespecimen to be confident of detecting a mutation if it is present.	PHI QAQ Null

3253	Comment:	PHI QAQ Null
3262	Mutations which affect the juxta-membrane domain (exon 11 and exon 13) of KIT result in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, leading to enhanced cell proliferation.  It has been demonstrated that patients with gastro-intestinal stromal tumours with similar juxta-membrane domain mutations respond to imatinib mesylate (Heinrich MC, J Surg Oncol. 2005;90:195).

While focal involvement of the left fallopian tube fimbria is seen (A9), the adjacent tubal epithelium shows no evidence of in situ carcinoma to suggest the lesion is of tubal origin. In view of the presence of endometriosis elsewhere in the specimen, the lesion may have potentially arisen in a focus of endometriosis.	PHI QAQ Null

1418	A. and B. The sections show a tumour nodule of recurrent astrocytoma in a background of normal temporal lobe. The tumour nodule is identified within specimen A and is composed of a diffuse proliferation of mild to moderately atypical astrocytic cells within a fibrillary background. Some of the cells show round nuclei within possiblevacuoles, imparting an 'oligodendroglial-like' appearance in some areas. The GFAP stain shows variable expression but some cells with round nuclei appear negative.	PHI QAQ Null

2154	Comment:	PHI QAQ Null
2163	The tumour is difficult to classify as there are overlapping morphological features between a low grade astrocytoma, WHO grade 2 and a low grade oligodendroglioma,WHO grade 2. The previous pathology was reviewed (14B35141). In the previous biopsy, the reporting pathologist also noted that morphologically the tumour was difficult to classify and in his opinion the features favoured a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. There was no evidence of 1p/19q co-deletion in previous testing.	IDNUM QAQ 14B35141   
2647	I have reviewed this case with Drs E Lewan and E Vaquero and the consensus opinion is that the current biopsy is consistent with a recurrent low grade glioma and the features favour a diagnosis of astrocytoma, WHO grade 2.	DOCTOR QAQ E Lewan   DOCTOR QAQ E Vaquero

5127	A.  Four lymph nodes show reactive changes only.  There is no evidence of malignancy (0/4).	PHI QAQ Null
5221	B.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma which fills and expands the the uterine cavity and is wildly invasive extending into the outer half of the myometrium of the uterus in both the anterior and posterior halves.  The tumour shows extensive solid and trabecular architecture with a lesser component of glandular architecture.  There is also moderate squamous differentiation.  There is extensive tumour necrosis predominantly superficially and centrally within tumour nests.  Focally there is an area of sheet-like growth in which tumour cells display more pronounced nuclear pleomorphism, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli (block B17). At its deepest point of invasion, in an area where the myometrium is relatively thin, the tumour extends close to the serosal surface, 22.8mm through a myometrium 23mm thick (B25).  Elsewhere the tumour invades 41.5mm throughmyometrium 48.5mm in maximal thickness B10/B11). The serosa does not appear involved by tumour.  There is extensive lymphovascular invasion both within the inner and outerhalf of the myometrium.  No definite perineural invasion is seen.  The cervix is uninvolved by tumour.  The uterus also shows several leiomyomata including a lipoleiomyoma which is focally invaded by carcinoma.  A leiomyoma is also present in the posterior lower segment expanding the stromal compartment of the cervix.  The ectocervix and endocervix are otherwise unremarkarkable and uninvolved by tumour. The mucosa of the left fallopian tube is expanded by foamy histiocytes, however, no carcinoma is seen.  The right fallopian tube is unremarkable.  The right and left ovaries are unremarkable and uninvolved.  Within the right parametrium there are two leiomyomas.	PHI QAQ Null

8266	At the request of Prof B Went immunohistochemical analysis of tumour mismatch repair protein expression is assessed.  The results are as follows:	DOCTOR QAQ B Went   
8412	Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins	PHI QAQ Null
8454	MLH1 Preserved nuclear staining	PHI QAQ Null
8486	PMS2  Preserved nuclear staining	PHI QAQ Null
8519	MSH2  Preserved nuclear staining	PHI QAQ Null
8552	MSH6  Abnormal loss of expression in two separate tests.	PHI QAQ Null
8610	Comment:	PHI QAQ Null
8619	Absence(loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.  In this case isolated loss of MSH6 protein expression may indicate the presence of an underlying isolated MSH6 mutation.  Further testing may be beneficial if clinically indicated advised.	PHI QAQ Null
9074	Preserved nuclearstaining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI QAQ Null

2583	Fixation artefact makes assessment of architecture difficult.  The tumour displays definite areas of ductal differentiation.  There are also areas of discohesive nested growth, probably related to fixation artefact and aminor component is arranged in trabeculae or single file arrays resembling infiltrating lobular carcinoma.  E cadherin expression is predominantly retained, including in the zones showing lobular like features. There are zones of absent or patchy E cadherin staining, mainly in the discohesive tumour and this probably relates to fixation artefact rather than true lobular differentiation.	PHI QAQ Null

2210	The surface mucinous deposits and granulation tissue has been extensively sampled. Over the surface of the bowel, there is granulation tissue. Over peritoneum and focally in omentum, there are multiple relatively small deposits of surface acellular mucin which isassociated with organising granulation tissue and  mesothelial hyperplasia. Some of the mucin is calcified. The mucin deposits form small rounded nodules and a thin surface layer in some areas.	PHI QAQ Null
2668	In this sampled multiple sections, convincing mucinous epithelium is NOT  demonstrated in any of the surface peritoneal mucin deposits. There are some reactive mesothelial cell clusters and a single small tubular structure which is in fibrin and not mucin and is considered probably mesothelial also (does not appear to be mucinous epithelium). There are some surface suture granulomas present.	PHI QAQ Null

3118	Comments:	PHI QAQ Null
3128	In my understanding, in the setting of an appenidiceal mucinous neoplasm, the finding of widespread peritoneal deposits of acellular mucin, is generally classified along with cases of disseminated low grade mucinous neoplasm with epithelium (low grade pseudomyxoma peritonei), although associated mucinous epithelium is not demonstrated for grading. The peritoneal disease then in this case is classified as	PHI QAQ Null

Also, sections of the colon show extensive deposits of extracellular mucin containing atypical mucinous epithelium, involving the serosa and mesentery, including the surface of the serosa and mesocolon.

4524	TEST DESCRIPTION/COMMENTS	PHI QAQ Null
4550	Samples arc screened for mutations inexons 2, 3 and 4 of the KRAS gene and exons 2, 3 and 4 of the NRAS gene. These exons contain the codona 12, 13, 59, 61. 117 and 146 that are frequently mutated in colorectal cancers. Mutations at these codons lead to constitutive activation of EGFR downstream pathways. Patients whose tumours have mutation in KRAS or NRAS are unlikely to benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR therapies.	PHI QAQ Null
4975	Approximately 35-45% of metastatic colorectal tumours harbour a KR.4Smutation whilst up to 6% will have a mutation in the NRAS gene. The vast majority (~90%) of all RAS mutations occur at codon 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene.	PHI QAQ Null
5207	Depending on sample quality, analysis is by Next Generation sequencing (massively parallel sequencing), Sanger sequencing, high resolution melt (HRM) analysis or pyrosequencing.

6212	MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION	PHI QAQ Null
6236	1. As reported, the large- mass in the hepatic left lobe is metastatic neuroendocrine tumour.  Part of the tumour shows the usual morphology which is predominantly of acinar type but with some trabecular areas.  However, much of the tumour also contains a second component which comprises an abnormal stromal proliferation. The stromal proliferation is most cellular around acinar structures which instead of being back-to-back are separated by the stroma but form nodular aggregates or elongated trabecular aggregates of these acini.  Further away from the epithelial elements, the stroma becomes less cellular and in some areas more myxoid with cells becoming much more spindling.  In the most cellular areas, the stromal proliferation comprises round to oval nuclei with moderately abundant clear vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are frequent (up to 5 per high power field) and there is some apoptosis.  No particular cytoplasmic differentiation is identified and no particular morphological evidence of rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation is seen.  This sarcomatous stroma appears to be confined to the nodule within the liver which appears reasonably well circumscribed.  Centrally within the nodule, there is quite extensive necrosis with cystic degeneration and some	PHI QAQ Null
7522	haemorrhage.	PHI QAQ Null
7535	The provided immunohistochemistry confirms the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour in the epithelial componentshowing a typical CK7 and CK20 negative cytokeratin profile and positive staining for chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, CD56 and neuron specific enolase.  There is diffuse positivity for CDX-2 and very focal positive staining of some neuroendocrine cells for both serotonin and somatostatin. TTF-1, insulin, glucagon and gastrin are negative.  There is no evidence staining of the stromal proliferation for cytokeratins (PanCK, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, CK5/6) but there is diffuse staining of the stromal component for vimentin.  There is some positivity for smooth muscle actin but much of this appears related to proliferating blood vessels and there is a similar, although possibly more widespread staining for desmin.Myogenin is negative, as are S 100 and CD99.	PHI QAQ Null
8400	Additional and repeat immunohistochemistry has been done at NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL. Cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2 show staining of the neuroendocrine component but no staining of the stromal component.  There is also totally negative staining for cytokeratins 5, 7 and 20, high molecular weight cytokeratin 34BE12 and p63. Neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A, synaptophysin and neuron specific enolase are strongly positive in the neuroendocrine component but show no staining of the stromal component.  CD56 at ORROROO CAMPUS is only weakly positive (?different clone of antibody).  There is very weak patchy positivity for S100.  Due to the very primitive nature of the stromal proliferation, germ cell markers were done. Alphafetoprotein, placental alkaline phosphatase and CD30 are negative.  CD117 is negative.  CD99 shows a weak non-specific pattern of staining.  Smooth muscle actin shows positivity in blood vessels only (a less marked reaction than the SOUTHERN YORKE PENINSULA HEALTH SERVICES stain) and desmin is essentially negative although there is some positivity in spindle cells in areas which appear degenerate and ischaemic, a finding that is difficult to interpret.  Mycogen is negative.  CD31and CD34 show a fine vascular network throughout the tumour only.	HOSPITAL QAQ NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL   HOSPITAL QAQ ORROROO CAMPUS   HOSPITAL QAQ SOUTHERN YORKE PENINSULA HEALTH SERVICES   
9681	Staining with somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) shows focal cytoplasmic and membrane positivity within the neuroendocrine component of the tumour although the reaction is fairly weak generally.	PHI QAQ Null
9875	However, glucose transporter I (GLUTI) is negative.  Positive staining with (GLUTI relates to FDG positivity on PET while SSTR2 positivity relates toGaTate positivity on PET.  It would be interesting to know what the degree of avidity on PET for both these was prior to surgery.	PHI QAQ Null
10154	Ki-67 estimation using the ROSEBUD HOSPITAL stain is estimated at 22% on the neuroendocrine component.  This is counting a hot spot in block A9 with 153/693 cells being positive. There is no defined standard as to the number of cells counted with recommended numbers varying between 500 and 2000.  The tumour is therefore, technically grade 3, although just so.  It is possible that if a larger number of cells were counted, the count would be below 20%.  The Ki-67 of the stromal component varies considerably averaging about 50% but in some areas getting up to 70-80%.	HOSPITAL QAQ ROSEBUD HOSPITAL

11196	COMMENT	PHI QAQ Null
11204	The morphology of the stromal component in the large metastasis within the left lobe of liver is of high grade sarcoma, NOS.  It appears to be intimately involved with the neuroendocrine component of the tumour with it surrounding and separating the neuroendocrine components of the tumour where stroma is predominant within the nodule.  Mitotic rate is high and there is necrosis.  The sarcomatous stroma appears confined to the metastasis and is not seen in two other hepatic metastases or in the primary neuroendocrine tumour.	PHI QAQ Null
11734	This is a distinctly unusual finding.  I have not seen this type of stromal proliferation in relation to any neuroendocrine tumours of gastroenteropancreatic type, nor can I find literature in relation to this whether relating to hepatic metastasis or primary pancreatic, gastric or enteric tumours of neuroendocrine type.  Tumours of this pattern have been described rarely in bladder, lung and thymus.	PHI QAQ Null
12138	In both bladder and lung, this sort of sarcomatoid stroma is usually associated with high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, either small cell or large cell type. However, in the thymus, there are rare cases of lower grade neuroendocrine tumours (thymic carcinoid) with accompanying sarcomatous stroma.  A case is illustrated in the WHO Blue Book Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart (2004), p 192-193.  The comment is made that these cases pursued a highly aggressive clinical course.	PHI QAQ Null
12630	The terminology is confusing, depending on the organ system that is being addressed, but it would seem reasonable to regard the metastasis in the liver as having biphasic differentiation, possibly being called neuroendocrine carcinosarcoma or sarcomatoid neuroendocrine carcinoma.  This case may be worthy of a case report in that itis a distinctly unusual finding and the literature is silent.  As there is no literature, it is not possible to predict outcome but to my mind it would be likely be considerably less favourable than if the sarcomatoid component was not present.	PHI QAQ Null

2997	A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a serous carcinoma.  Much of the tumour is moderately differentiated, comprising slit-like glands and some papillae lined by epithelial cells with highly pleomorphic nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm.  However there is a significant proportion which consists of solid sheets and trabeculae of tumour cells so overall it is poorly differentiated.  The tumour involves the body and fundus of the uterus anteriorly and posteriorly.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion measures 9.5mm where total myometrial thickness is 14mm.  There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium, some of which is well away from the main invasive tumour.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Two small leiomyomas, and adenomyosis, are noted in the myometrium.  Sections of the ovaries show several small simple cysts bilaterally.  The ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.	PHI QAQ Null

4630	Endometrialcancer with loss of MLH1 expression.	PHI QAQ Null
4678	Background:	PHI QAQ Null
4690	HNPCC is most often caused by a heterozygous deleterious mutation within one of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2).  However, somatic hyper-methylation or constitutional epimutation of one of these genes can produce a similar phenotype.  Detection of methylation in the promoter region of one of these genes may be useful in determining the heritability of a cancer.	PHI QAQ Null
5076	Method	PHI QAQ Null
5083	Methylation testing is carried out on DNA extracted from paraffin embedded tumour tissue using a methylation-sensitive multiplex-ligation dependent probeamplification (MS-MLPA) technique.  Methylation-sensitive probes are protected from digestion when bound to the patient's methylated DNA and are subsequently amplified by PCR.  If the patient's DNA is not methylated a product will not beproduced.	PHI QAQ Null
5483	This method targets methylation sites in the MLH1 promoter corresponding to regions A, B, C and D (Deng et al) and in intron I.  It has been shown that methylation at regions C and D correlates with reduced MLH1 expression, whereas methylation at other sites is non-specific (Capel et al).  The MS-MLPA method provides an estimation of the percentage methylation at each site with a result of greater than 10% considered to be positive.	PHI QAQ Null

The carcinoma involves both the anterior and posterior uterine body and contiguously invades into the outer half of the myometrium, 8.5mm through myometrium 10mm  thick (block A9). The carcinoma invades the stroma of the lower segment (blocks A1 & A6) but does not reach the endocervix.  The carcinoma is composed of tumour cells with grade 3 nuclei and arranged in sheets, trabeculae and cords within a desmoplastic stroma.  Only minor abortive glandular differentiation  is present (grade 3architecture).  Focally, the carcinoma shows squamoid differentiation, however, no intercellular prickles or keratinization is seen (block A8).  No sarcomatoid features are seen.  There is focal in-situ endometrioid adenocarcinoma (block A11).  There are moderate areas of tumour necrosis, especially superficially.There are several foci of lymphovascular invasion just beyond the advancing front of tumour, in the outer half of the myometrium (block A8 & A11).  No outlying foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen.  The carcinoma is well clear (greater than 20mm) of the ectocervical margin.

1276	The entire specimen has been embedded and examined.  Sections show a multinodular goitre.  The thyroid is composed of multiple hyperplastic nodules with a mixed microfollicular and macrofollicular architecture.  There are rare lymphoidaggregates and occasional nodules showing Hurthle cell change. There are areas of degenerative change with cystic formation, acute and subacute haemorrhage, fibrosis and dystrophic calcification.  Several of the nodules show variably defined investing fibrous capsules.	PHI QAQ Null
1783	Arising within an unencapsulated mainly follicular-patterned nodule (Blocks 22-25), approximately 20mm in maximum dimension, is a multifocal papillary carcinoma with a mixed follicular and papillary architecture.  The side of the nodule is unclear as the specimen is received unoriented.  The exact dimensions of the carcinomatous component is difficult to determine as the carcinoma transitions to, and is intermingled with,follicles showing a spectrum of variable nuclear atypia, regarded as indefinite for papillary carcinoma, as well as benign follicles.  The atypical nuclear features include variable nuclear enlargement, nuclear pallor, patchy mild crowding, patchy irregularity and occasional grooves.  Some atypical follicles also contain hypereosinophilic colloid.  The whole nodule shows abrupt transition to adjacent follicles lined by low cuboidal bland epithelium. In contrast to the atypical follicles, the foci of convincing papillary carcinoma show distinct nuclear features of papillary carcinoma including rare intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions and include foci with papilliform architecture.  A 1.2mm focus of papillary carcinoma arranged in follicles is also present immediately adjacent to the 20mm nodule (Block 22).  With immunostains CK19 highlights foci with more pronounced nuclear atypia including diffuse staining of the definite carcinomatous foci, while HBME1 shows more widespread but non-diffuse staining of the 20mm nodule. No lymphovascular invasion is seen.   The clearance is difficult to assess as follicles with nuclear crush artefact, continuous with the 20mm nodule,focally abut the disrupted margin of resection (23, 23L2). Elsewhere the nodule is separated from the margin by the thin fibrous pseudocapsule of the lobe, <0.1mm clear( 24).  One normal parathyroid gland is also present. No perithyroidlymph nodes are seen.	PHI QAQ Null
3650	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
3659	Arising within a 20mm mainly follicular patterned nodule are multiple foci of papillary carcinoma.  Approximately 30% of the nodule shows definite nuclear features of carcinoma. Within theremainder of the nodule a substantial proportion of follicles display atypical nuclear features, regarded as indefinite for papillary carcinoma; these foci may represent follicular hyperplasia with nuclear atypia. Consensus amongst pathologists is lacking as to how to determine the maximum size of the carcinomatous component in these circumstances, although some may regard the entire 20mm nodule as carcinomatous.

390	Sections show a punchbiopsy of skin including epidermis and dermis.  The epidermis shows patchy parakeratosis and moderate spongiosis with focal early vesicle formation.  Neutrophils are present in the stratum corneum focally, suggesting excoriation.  The superficial dermis is oedematous and has a mild and moderate perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.  There are also scattered interstitial eosinophils in the superficial dermis.  Focal red cell extravasation is noted in the superficial dermis and extending into the epidermis.  There is no vasculitis.	PHI QAQ Null
952	The features areof a subacute spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophils.  While there are a few discrete mounds of parakeratosis and there is focal haemorrhage in the superficial dermis, the features favour a drug reaction rather than pityriasis rosea or chronic superficial dermatitis (digitate dermatosis).

1502	The 280mm intra-abdominal lesion is a mesenteric fibromatosis. The fibromatosis is unencapsulated and appears largely circumscribed. The tumour is composed of bland to plump spindled cells with normochromic nucleiand pin-point nucleoli. The cells are arranged in loose fascicles within focally fibromyxoid stroma, with scattered intercellular aggregates of dense keloidal-type collagen and focally telangiectatic vessels. Scattered foci of extravasated red blood cells are seen. There is no significant cytologic atypia, significant mitotic activity or necrosis. The tumour abuts the muscularis propria of the overlying adherent segment of small bowel, which appears otherwise unremarkable. At the mesenteric surgical margin, tongues of tumour infiltrate between mature mesenteric fibroadipose tissue, and focally abut the surgical margin. Ten mesenteric lymph nodes showing reactive changes are identified (0/10).	PHI QAQ Null

In block two, adjacent to the surgical cavity at 4 o'clock, there is a 2.2mm collection of ducts showing partial expansion by atypical discohesive cells, most in keeping with ALH/LCIS. In block 7, within an area of fat necrosis adjacent to the surgical cavity at 9 - 10 o'clock, there is a 0.56mm focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia. Both theALH/LCIS and ADH are clear of margins (>10mm). In addition, there is a separate discrete focus of scarring associated with a prominent foreign body giant cell reaction, corresponding to the fibrotic area seen macroscopically at 2 o'clock 16cm FN, and most likely representing a previous site of biopsy/surgery. The surrounding breast tissue shows a spectrum of proliferative changes including fibrocystic change, columnar cell change, adenosis and apocrine metaplasia. Scattered suture granulomas are also present. Eighteen axillary lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/18). An incidental benign capsular lymph node inclusion is seen.

There is similar tumour in the omentum and small metastatic deposits are present in both ovaries and over the surface of one fallopian tube.  There is also discontinuous focus ?metastasis in cervical tissue deep to ectocervix.  The pattern of invasion in the uterus would favour a primary endometrial carcinoma and the case is reported as this.  In the sections examined of tumour the carcinoma is viable with no areas of necrosis.  The tumour has a predominantly angulated pattern of invasive glands and there is high grade nuclear atypia.

8037	Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatelliteinstability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	PHI QAQ Null
8266	Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI QAQ Null

3380	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	PHI QAQ Null
3648	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI QAQ Null

3158	At the request of Dr X Dirago the margins of excision of specimen C (retroperitoneal tumour) are assessed.  The specimenwas received unoriented and was not inked grossly making assessment of margins difficult, however, in areas there is peripheral diathermy artefact or a surface layer of red blood cells consistent with the line of excision.  In an area where the specimen appears disrupted the tumour appears to reach the diathermy line over a front of about 4mm and completeness of excision is therefore regarded as doubtful (Block C3 & C4).

1763	A.  Section of the livershow a 60mm deposit of metastatic carcinoma. The carcinoma is relatively well circumscribed with a thin fibrous pseudocapsule at the advancing edge. The tumour has a mixed papillary, alveolar and nested architecture with large areas of haemorrhage. The cells are large and polygonal with abundant clear to granular eosinophilic cytoplasm with patchy intracytoplasmic Schmorls positive melanin. The nuclei are central to eccentrically located with coarse to vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.  There are also occasional cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and/or multiple nuclei, prominent macronucleoli, consistent with Fuhrmann and ISUP grade 4. In some areas there are vaguely nodular areas of smaller cells surrounded by areas of larger more pleomorphic cells.  Rare foci of psammomatous calcifications are seen.  Mitosis are inconspicuous (less than 1/10 hpf) and there are patchy small foci of necrosis comprising than 5% of the tumour.  There are patchy foci of intratumoural acute and subacute haemorrhage.

2070	A.  Sections show liver tissue with deposits of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent with metastases from colon/rectum.  The tumours are extensively necrotic and the necrotic tissue shows some dystrophic calcification.  Some groups and cords of apparent viable tumour cells are identified in each of the sampled deposits.  One deposit extends to just beneath the capsular surface butno tumour is seen on the peritoneal surface.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The hepatic resection margin is confirmed to be free of tumour.	PHI QAQ Null
2633	A section of liver away from the tumour deposits shows some mild nonspecific changes including mild centrilobular congestion and mild cholestasis.  Thereis no significant inflammatory infiltrate.  With special stains there is no significant fibrosis, there is no increase in stainable iron in hepatocytes, no alpha-1-antitrypsin globules are seen, a rhodamine stain for copper is negative, and an orcein stain for hepatitis B surface antigen is negative.

3088	B.  Sections show liver tissue with deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The subcapsular deposits has scattered cords of residual apparent viable tumour cells but most of the nodule is necrotic.  No tumour is seen on the capsular surface.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The resection margin is confirmed to be free of tumour.  The smaller deposit consists of extracellular mucus and necrotic material with infiltration by macrophages; only occasional degenerate appearing tumour cells are identified in this deposit.  The described small cream coloured area on the liver capsule is an area of old, densefibrosis; no tumour is seen in relation to this nodule.	PHI QAQ Null

2000	There are invasive areas of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in which the glands are seen to be separate from the main tumour mass and are invading the muscularis propria, associated with a desmoplastic reaction.	PHI QAQ Null
2222	The tumour does not appear to invade through the full thickness of muscularis propria (T2), however, acellular mucin is seen to dissect through the wall and is present at the serosal surface with an accompanying peritonitis.	PHI QAQ Null
2447	Areas of full thickness inflammation, haemorrhage and fibrinous exudate are present, consistent with perforation.	PHI QAQ Null
2562	The proximal margin is clear of tumour by approximately 10mm, although pools of extravasated mucin are present within the serosa at the proximal margin.	PHI QAQ Null
2715	There is no lymphovascular or perineural invasion and no lymph nodes were identified in the specimen (NX).	PHI QAQ Null

390	A.  UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, TUBES, RECTOSIGMOID COLON . Uterus, bilateralfallopian tubes and ovaries, bowel and attached fatty tissue. Orientation is difficult but the specimen consists of uterus which is 80mm from fundus to resection margin, 55mm wide and 45mm from anterior to posterior. The left fallopian tube and ovary are difficult to identify. The left fallopian tube is approximately 20x5mm and the ovary 20x10x10mm. Directly posterior to the ?ovary is a cyst filled with mucinous/pus like material. It is 10mm in diameter. The right fallopian tube is 70x70x5-10mm. The right ovary consists of a solid/cystic/mucinous/papillary mass which is 150x120x80mm. The papillary area is on the external surface and covers an area of 80mm. The cyst is 100x80mm and the solid areas arepresent through the lesion and appear to be filled with a yellow mucinous/necrotic material. A number of papillary lesions are present on the surface of the solid areas. This mass is attached to the posterior surface of the uterus andto the segment of bowel which is located on the left posterior side and measures 120mm in length and 40mm in diameter. The mucosa of the wall is 5mm and the mucosal surface appears unremarkable.	PHI QAQ Null

3040	A.  Sections of the cervix show endocervical glandular epithelium. No squamous mucosa is seen. The endomtrium appears inactive/weakly proliferative. In the myometrium there are benign leiomyomas. The left ovary has been identified and shows several benign epithelialinclusions and with endometriosis of the left ovary. The cystic structure posterior to the left ovary consists of necrotic tumour with features of an infiltrating well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with columnar epithelium. Desmoplastic stromal reaction is present. There is papillary/villoglandular architecture within cystic space. Cytoplasmic clearing is also seen in the apical cytoplasm in some areas.	PHI QAQ Null
3728	The surface papillary tumour of the right adnexal mass shows a villoglandular morphology with columnar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and with many cells showing apical cilia, mucin stains demonstrate some intracytoplasmic mucinous differentiation. Cytologic atypia including mitotic activity, multilayering/pseudostratification and nucleoli and mild nuclear shape variation seen. Polymorph neutrophils are seen within epithelium and within cystic space. Sections of the adjacent solid tumour show similar features but with more apical cytoplasm although ciliated cells are also seen. Apical cytoplasmic clearing is also seen insome areas. Complex architecture is seen in the solid areas. Large cystic spaces are lined by similar atypical epithelium. Tumour is also seen with small infiltrative glands  adherent to the posterior uterine surface and the anterior uterine surface, and in this region there is also adjacent endometriosis. In association with the infiltrating adenocarcinomathere is squamous differentiation with a desmoplastic stromal reaction (block A2). Endometriosis is also seen in this region.	PHI QAQ Null
4845	Sections of the colon including the resection margins are unremarkable. Tumour is adherent to thepericolic/perirectal adipose tissue with villoglandular pattern tumour with a desmoplastic stromal reaction identified in this area. A small amount of psammomatous calcification is seen in association with the tumour.	PHI QAQ Null

5279	D.  Sections of the appendix show serosal acute inflammation and serosal endometriosis/endosalpingiosis.	PHI QAQ Null
5385	E.  The sections show a small amount of fatty tissue with serosal acute and chronic infalmmation and mesothelial reaction and a small amount of infiltrating adenocarcinoma with desmoplastic stromal reaction.	PHI QAQ Null
5594	.  The sections show fibrofatty tissue in which there is endometriosis and endosalpingiosis and with infiltrating nodules of well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with well formed glandular spaces and desmoplastic stromal reaction. There is columnar cell morphology with apical cytoplasmic clearing.	PHI QAQ Null
5906	G. The sections show skeletal muscle with adipose tissue and fibrous tissue and this is infiltrated by a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with glandular and partial villous architecture. There is columnar cell morphology with apical cytoplasmic clearing. In addition, areas of squamous differentiation are identified.	PHI QAQ Null
6241	H.  The sections show lobulated fatty tissue consistent with omentum with mesothelial reaction. There are also deposits of infiltrating adenocarcinoma with desmoplastic stromal reaction with glandular morphology with columnar epithelium.	PHI QAQ Null
6480	Immunohistochemistry (block G1): The tumour is positive for CAM5.2, and CK7. CK20 and CDX-2 are negative. CEA stains squamous differentiation in tumour. Pax-8 shows weak to modeate nuclear staining. Oestrogen receptor shows moderate to strong staining. Progesteroner eceptor shows pathcy positive staining.	PHI QAQ Null
6788	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
6797	The appearances are those of an adenocarcinoma with mixed morphological features. There are features favoured to represent a predominant endometrioid differentiation (including cytoplasmic clearing imparting a so-called 'secretory' appearance), and with villoglandular architecture in many areas. The surface papillary component however has a somewhat 'seromucinous' appearance. In addition, focal areas of squamous differentiation in sections from the paracervical region and the wound nodule (consistent with squamous differentiation in endometioid adenocarcinoma).	PHI QAQ Null
7366	There is endometriosis in several sections examined.	PHI QAQ Null
7420	Overall, the tumour is favoured to represent a well to moderately differentiated predominantly endometrioid adenocarcinoma with some mixed Mullerian differentiation. It is centred in the right adnexal region.	PHI QAQ Null

8315	Comment:	PHI QAQ Null
8324	Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	PHI QAQ Null
8554	Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI QAQ Null
8689	The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.	PHI QAQ Null

2949	A.  The specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sections show a epithelial predominant malignant mixed mullerian tumour (MMMT) centred within and replacing much of the right ovary, but also involving and expanding the lumen andwall of the right fallopian tube.  The tumour is predominantly (approximately 90%) composed of high grade serous carcinoma, however, a minority of the tumour (<5%) is associated with malignant stroma (A21) and by convention is classified as a MMMT.  No heterologous stromal differentiation is seen.  Approximately 10% of the tumour is poorly differentiated or shows clear cell differentiation (e.g. A20). A minute component of the tumour, sampled for frozen section showspossible squamous differentiation, however, no convincing endometrioid component is seen.  The carcinoma displays papillary, micropapillary and trabecular architecture and is composed of mitotically active cells with high grade nuclearfeatures.  There are extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour extends very close to but does not appear to penetrate the serosal surface.  There is associated surface haemorrhage and mesothelial proliferation.  The carcinoma involves thewall of the fallopian tube it expands much of the lumen.  The fimbrial end of the tube is not identified.   No lymphovascular invasion is seen.	PHI QAQ Null

508	MACROSCOPIC:	PHI QAQ Null
521	Specimen labelled  Lesion left chest wall stitch 12 o'clock  consists of an excision of skin with underlying soft tissue including skeletal muscle, 110 x 95 x 25mm.  There is a suture at one end indicating 12 o'clock.  There is a haemorrhagic fungatinglesion 35 x 25 x 15mm, located over the 6 o'clock half.  The lesion extends towards the 12 o'clock margin beneath the skin.  The lesion is 75 x 60 x 30mm.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and 9 o'clock black.  The specimen was serially sectioned from 12 towards 6 o'clock into twelve slices (slice one = 12 o'clock, slice twelve = 6 o'clock).  The tumour appears encapsulated with central areas of necrosis surrounded by haemorrhagic areas.  The capsule of the tumour abuts the deep and 12 o'clock margin, and is 2mm clear of the 3 o'clock margin, 15mm clear of the 9 o'clock margin and 25mm clear of the 6 o'clock margin.  The tumour does not appear to infiltrate the skeletal muscle.	PHI QAQ Null

2110	Sections are ofskin extending to deep subcutaneous tissue, including skeletal muscle at the deep aspect. There is an ulcerated crateriform lesion consisting of acutely inflamed fibrinous ulcer slough overlying a central core of laminated thrombus and extensive organising fibrin/haemorrhage. In areas, the organising fibrin/haemorrhage has a papilliform appearance, with cores of fibrin covered by plump endothelial cells. The endothelial cells show no significant cytologic atypia or mitotic activity. Necrosis is inconspicuous. At its periphery, the lesion is circumscribed and is surrounded by a variably thick irregular cuff of dense hyalinised fibrocollagenous tissue, organising fibrosis and fat necrosis. Special stains (Masson's trichrome, orcein and reticulin) highlight the cuff of hyalinised fibrous tissue, and although scattered distorted elastin fibers are present, no unequivocal elastic laminae are seen. Scattered collections of foamy histiocytes and cholesterol clefts are contained within the fibrocollagenous tissue. The fibrocollagenous tissue abuts the 12 o'clock (block 1) and deep margins (block 9), is 1.1mm from the 3 o'clock margin (block 4) and appearsclear of remaining margins. No infiltration of the surrounding dermocutaneous tissue by atypical cells or a vasoformative lesion is seen. The overlying intact epidermis shows reactive change and mild to moderate acute inflammatory cell exocytosis.	PHI QAQ Null
3540	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
3549	The 35mm ulcerated left chest wall mass is a circumscribed lesion composedof acute ulcer slough overlying a central core of organising fibrin/haemorrhage and surrounded by a variably thick cuff of fibrous tissue. There is no significant cytologic atypia, mitotic activity, necrosis or infiltration of surroundingtissues.	PHI QAQ Null
3871	Overall, the features are most in keeping with a Masson's tumour (Papillary endothelial hyperplasia). Masson's tumours are considered to be exuberant forms of organising thrombus, and although most arise within the lumen of a vessel, extravascular Masson's tumours arise within haematomas at any site, and may present as deep soft tissue lesions. The pathologic differential diagnosis includes an angiosarcoma, however, the absenceof endothelial multi-layering, mitoses, necrosis and infiltration of the surrounding tissue, make this diagnosis unlikely.	PHI QAQ Null
4425	The case will be sent to the Bone and Soft Tissue Meeting (DORRIGO MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE) for a second opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.	HOSPITAL QAQ DORRIGO MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE

1672	Sections show a moderate to poorly differentiated carcinoma which is difficult to classify according to the morphological and immunohistochemical features.	PHI QAQ Null
1828	The tumour shows a circumscribed low power growth pattern and is composed of sheets and nests of atypical epithelioid cells with moderate amounts of eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm.	PHI QAQ Null
2012	There is a branching thin walled vasculature throughout the tumour, imparting a vague papillary architecture with occasional tumour cells having a columnar morphology.	PHI QAQ Null

2260	No convincing clear cell changeis seen.	PHI QAQ Null

354	A.  Specimen labelled  Subtotal gastrectomy transverse colon  consists of en bloc subtotal gastrectomy with a segment of transverse colon.  The stomach is 215mm along the greater curvature and 125mm along the lesser curvature.  There is attached greater omentum 320 x 220 x 40mm, and lesser omentum 125 x 60 x 10mm.  The transverse colon is 100mm in length and75mm circumference.  There is included transverse mesocolon 65mm in width.  Over the anterior surface of the antral greater curvature there is adherent peritoneum, 75 x 30mm.  Arising within the gastric antrum, over the greater curvatureis an ulcerated tumour with a raised rolled edge.  The tumour is 90 x 75mm.  The tumour is 70mm clear of the proximal margin and 25mm clear of the distal margin.  The tumour infiltrates through the muscularis propria and into the transverse mesocolic fat.  The tumour does not appear to involve the transverse colon mucosa or muscularis propria.  There is induration and puckering of the gastric serosa over the greater curvature adjacent to the adherent peritoneum.  There is also puckering of the transverse mesocolon peritoneum.  The areas of serosal puckering are inked blue.  There is flattening of the uninvolved gastric antral rugae, immediately adjacent to the tumour.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.	PHI QAQ Null

The gastric antrum to duodenum measures 323mm in length x 55mm in open diameter.  The common bile duct segment measures approximately 35mm in length x 8mm in diameter.  The pancreas body measures 65 x 35 x 32mm.  There are lymph nodes within the peripancreatic fat.  The peripancreatic fat measures approximately 80 x 70 x 40mm and surrounds the pancreas anteriorly and posteriorly.	PHI QAQ Null
866	The specimen is inked as follows: black- distal duodenal margin, blue- proximal duodenal margin (gastric antrum), blue- anterior pancreas, black- posterior pancreas, red- portal vein margin, green- pancreatic neck margin, and yellow- uncinate process.	PHI QAQ Null
1118	The duodenal serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  On opening, the thickness of the wall is 5mm.  The mucosa is brown to dark red over the distal portion of the duodenum over a length of 190mm from the distal margin. There is an abrupt transition to tan mucosa at 170mm from the gastric antrum.	PHI QAQ Null
1417	The pancreas has a tan circumscribed tumour measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm adjacent to the common bile duct.  The margins are as follows:  5mm posterior, 3mm from the common bile duct wall, more than 20mm from the common bile duct margin, 20mm from the portal vein margin, 40mm from the pancreatic neck margin, 45mm from the anterior pancreas and wellaway (approximately 55mm) from the uncinate margin. The rest of the pancreatic parenchyma appears unremarkable.  At the distal end near the uncinate pancreas there is a well circumscribed firm tan nodule within the peripancreatic fat. This could represent a lymph node.  The surface of this mass is partly filled with a white creamy material.  There is associated firm fibrosis which is adherent to the serosal surfaceof the duodenum, and spreads within the peripancreatic fat. This area of fibrosis measures 15 x 10 x 6mm.	PHI QAQ Null

2320	The previous biopsy from WARREN MULTI PURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE Hospital, reported as well differentiated liposarcoma (ZO61054250), has been reviewed.  There is some resemblance in the appearances of this previous biopsy and the present specimen, however the previous biopsy is more cellular and there are more atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei than in the present specimen.  It seems most likely that the previous diagnosis is correct and that infection was introduced at the biopsy procedure, possibly by breaching the bowel.  The previous biopsy is being sent for FISH testing to look for MDM2 amplification to try and confirm the diagnosis of liposarcoma; a supplementary report will be issued.

3342	Immunoperoxidase stain for MDM2 shows between 25% to 50% of tumour cells with either nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining.  Only nuclear staining is regarded as overexpression of MDM2.  However, the MDM2 antibody for immunoperoxidase staining is only used for experimental purposes and should not be used for diagnostic purposes.	PHI QAQ Null
3673	My understanding is that the MDM2 immunostain is less sensitive than FISH for detecting an MDM2 amplification but that a positive stain is helpful.  In this context it supports the diagnosis of well differentiated liposarcoma.	PHI QAQ Null

6452	Comment:	PHI QAQ Null
6461	Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	PHI QAQ Null
6691	Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI QAQ Null

2147	Sections of the 53mm paraspinal lesion confirm the presence of recurrent sarcoma. The sarcoma has variably infiltrative margins and is partially surrounded by dense fibrocollagenous tissue and skeletal muscle. The sarcoma is moderately cellular and consists of highly pleomorphic epithelioid to stellate cells arranged in sheets and ill defined fascicles within fibromyxoid stroma. The tumour cells show coarsely clumped vesicular chromatin with variably prominent nucleoli. Scattered multinucleate and occasional bizarre cells are present. The tumour contains numerous small calibre blood vessels, including some larger haemangio-pericytomatous vessels, many of which show mural fibrosis, fibrinoid change and luminal thrombi, in keeping with the history of radiotherapy. The tumour shows scattered foci of haemorrhagic cystic change, but discrete foci of necrosis are inconspicuous. There are scattered mitoses. No diagnostic lymphovascular space invasion or perineural invasion is seen.	PHI QAQ Null

3687	The 53mm paraspinal lesion shows features consistent with recurrent sarcoma. The morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining is similar to that the previously reportedcore biopsy (65A34682) and would be in keeping with a (pleomorphic) leiomyosarcoma.The tumour shows high grade cytologic atypia (tumour differentiation score = 3), however, formal histologic grading was not performed as it may be unreliable after neoadjuvant therapy.	IDNUM QAQ 65A34682   
4134	The tumour contains scattered vessels showing changes consistent withradiotherapy. However, there is no significant tumour necrosis (ie. poor treatment response). The medial and deep margins are positive.	PHI QAQ Null

1504	Sections of the distal pancreas show a multilocular cystic tumour lined in the majority of areas by tall columnar, mucin producing epithelium whilst in other areas the epithelium is more attenuated and cuboidal.  Focal intestinal metaplasia is present. There is minimal cytological and architectural atypia.  Ovarian-like stroma surrounds many of the cysts.  The features are consistent with a mucinouscystic neoplasm with low grade dysplasia (mucinous cystadenoma).   The tumour appears completely excised.

6575	The K-Ras oncogene has been screened for mutations in exon 2, codons 12 and 13.  K-Ras mutations have been associated with resistance to Erbitux.  The purpose of this screening is to determine theK-Ras mutation status in the tumour of an individual affected by colorectal cancer.  This status will be used to predict the patient's response to Erbitux.	PHI QAQ Null
6929	RESULT: NEGATIVE - MUTATION NOT IDENTIFIED.	PHI QAQ Null
6974	Methods Employed:	PHI QAQ Null
6992	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pyrosequencing.	PHI QAQ Null
7044	COMMENT:	PHI QAQ Null
7053	This result indicates that the patient may benefit from treatment with Erbitux. However, a negative result does not rule out the possibility of a mutation being present in another exon or in codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 at levels below the threshold of detection (5%).  [Results obtained from block: 49Q65458.C5.  NB:tested area contains ~85% tumour] .	IDNUM QAQ 49Q65458

2842	A.  Sections show multifocal high grade serous adenocarcinoma in the uterus and cervix. Foci of carcinoma are seen within the endometrium, myometrium, uterine serosa, cervical stroma and at the posterior cervical serosal surface. Foci of lymphovascular space invasion are seen. The adjacent endometrium appears inactive with focal cystic atrophy. The myometrium shows adenomyosis. There is no evidence of Human papillomavirus or CIN.	PHI QAQ Null
3278	B.  Sectionsof the right ovary show scattered foci of high grade serous adenocarcinoma. There is a focus suspicious for lymphovascular space invasion. Adenocarcinoma is present less than 0.1mm from the ovarian serosal surface focally (B15). Sectionsof the right fallopian tube fimbrial end show extensive involvement by serous adenocarcinoma, which effaces the epithelium, infiltrates through the tubal wall, and is very close to the serosal surface. Foci suspicious for lymphovascularspace invasion are seen. No definite fallopian tube carcinoma in situ is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
3843	C.  Sections of the left ovary show extensive involvement by high grade serous adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma has a mixed papilliform, solidand cribriform architecture and shows prominent areas of cystic/haemorrhagic change. There are scattered foci of lymphovascular space invasion (C10), as well as, ovarian surface involvement (C7). Sections of the fallopian tube show scattered malignant cells within the fallopian tube lumen, however, no diagnostic in situ tubal dysplasia or CIS is seen.	PHI QAQ Null
4342	D.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic high grade serous adenocarcinoma, up to 8.0mm. A focus suspicious for lymphovascular space invasion is present. An involved lymph node is also identified (1/1). The adjacent omentum shows patchy mild to moderate chronic inflammation and patchy mild reactive mesothelial hyperplasia.	PHI QAQ Null
4683	E.  The appendix has been examined in its entirety. The appendix shows fibrous obliteration of the lumen. There is patchy mild acute serositis, but there is no evidence of acute appendicitis.

560	A.   Specimen labelled  Right shoulder mass stitch 12 o'clock , consists ofan orientated ellipse of skin measuring 125 x 35mm to a depth of 50mm. There is a suture attached to one pole marking 12 o'clock. The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 9 o'clock margin is inked black and the deep margin is inked red.  The deep margin appears somewhat irregular and fragmented.  The specimen is serially sectioned in the transverse plane into fourteen slices from slice 1 - 12 o'clock margin to slice 14 - 6 o'clock margin.  There is a cream firm relatively well circumscribed lesion identified in slices 5-9 measuring 25mm (3-9 o'clock) x 28mm (12-6 o'clock) x 20mm (superficial to deep). Thelesion appears to come to 2mm from the 3 o'clock margin, 17mm from the deep margin, 28mm from the 9 o'clock margin and well clear of both the 12 and 6 o'clock margins.  Block 1 & 2- slice 1; 3 - slice 5; 4-7 - slice 6; 8-11 - slice 7; 12 & 13 -slice 8; 14 & 15 - slice 14. Please refer to attached diagram.	PHI QAQ Null

1903	A. Sections show a cellular proliferation of bland fibroblastic spindle cells arranged in broad fascicles, with interspersed thin walled vessels and occasional chronic inflammatory cells. The nuclei areoval and slightly enlarged with finely granular chromatin and small distinct nucleoli.	PHI QAQ Null
2193	Mitoses are infrequent (approximately 2 per 10 hpf) and no atypical forms are identified. No necrosis or heterologous elements are seen.	PHI QAQ Null
2330	The spindle cells show positive nuclear staining with beta-Catenin and patchy staining with smooth muscle actin and desmin. Ki67 expression is low(1 - 2%). The tumour cells are negative for S100	PHI QAQ Null
2526	The lesion has a reasonably defined edge with stag-horn extensions into adjacent fibroadipose tissue. Focally the lesion extends to within 1mm of the blue inked 3 o'clock margin.	PHI QAQ Null
2705	The lesion also extends close (within 1mm) of the deep margin but this margin was noted to be somewhat fragmented macroscopically and the relation of this close margin to overlying skeletal muscle is uncertain.	PHI QAQ Null
2916	B. Sections show fibroadipose tissue. No evidence of tumour is seen and all of the tissue has been embedded.	PHI QAQ Null

939	Sections show a fatty tumour.There is moderate variability in size and shape of adipocytes.  There is oedema and there is a mild, patchy infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells.  There is also some fat necrosis with infiltration by macrophages.  No significant cytologic atypia is identified apart from the variability in size and shape of adipocytes.  No definite lipoblasts are identified.  The features are favoured to be those of a benign fatty tumour (lipoma) which has some mild atypical features.  However if confident exclusion of atypical lipomatous tumour/well differentiated liposarcoma is thought desirable than FISH to look for MDM2 amplification may be worthwhile.	PHI QAQ Null
1621	The mass is partly surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule but it appears to extend to part of the inked excision margin (eg blocks 3, 3).  Tumour is seen extending into skeletal muscle, between muscle bundles, in one area near the edge (block 3).	IDNUM QAQ 3   IDNUM QAQ 3   IDNUM QAQ 3
